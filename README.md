## Motivation

I started around three years ago to work on different topics. I did all the work in a directory on my pc, but it became unmanageable. The idea of doing something cool every day drove me. I realized I didn't share anything, and because of that, most of it is useless, forgotten, or abandoned. That is sad because I love some of those projects.

Working on this repository is among one the best decisions I made. I discovered so much thanks to it. I can never know the beast an initial idea will develop into.
