# Srecko Kostic - Experiments

Srecko Kostic's collection of experiments and reading topic wishlist in form of issues. This repository puts it all together.

I start to like this repository. It serves as a history and a tool to reflect. I can see how much I've improved.

## Motivation to learn as much as possible

Lack of knowledge creates tech debt. We can create software with very little technical knowledge. For example, we can create a big server using only GET requests. That doesn't mean it is the correct way to do it. Another example is writing a program using C++ and using the keyword `new` everywhere. Even worse, we don't use `delete` to free the memory. However, there are other situations where we can implement the solution whichever way we need to. For example, from my previous research, adding required C++ libraries for a project seems difficult. From my **CURRENT UNDERSTANDING** _(which may be wrong)_ we can split solutions in two categories:

- There is a standard way to do it and best practices to follow. For example, we should use `unique_ptr` instead of `new` and `delete`.
- There is no standard way to do it. For example, how to add a C++ library to a project.

However, a project may have decided on its strategy of adding a library. Therefore in the outside world, there is no best practice for adding a C++ library, but a project has a set of guidelines for how they do it.

## Experiments

- [JavaScript](./javascript)
- [C++](./cpp)
- [Python](./python)
- [PowerShell](./powershell)
- [Sandbox](./sandbox)

## Motivation

I started around three years ago to work on different topics. I did all the work in a directory on my pc, but it became unmanageable. The idea of doing something cool every day drove me. I realized I didn't share anything, and most of it is useless, forgotten, or abandoned. That is sad because I love some of those projects.

This repository started small and grew until it had a couple of projects, and each of them had node_modules or some weird setup.
