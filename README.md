# Srecko Kostic - Experiments

Srecko Kostic's collection of experiments and reading topic wishlist in form of issues. This repository puts it all together.

I start to like this repository. It servers as history and a tool to reflect back. I can see how much I've improved.

## Experiments

- [JavaScript](./javascript/README.md)
- [C++](./cpp/README.md)
- [Python](./python/README.md)

## Motivation

I started around three years ago to work on different topics. I did all the work in a directory on my pc, but it became unmanageable. The idea of doing something cool every day drove me. I realized I didn't share anything, and most of it is useless, forgotten, or abandoned. That is sad because I love some of those projects.

This repository started small and grew until it had a couple of projects, and each of them had node_modules or some weird setup.

## Lessons

Technical debt is inevitable, but that is fine. The good behavior of computer scientists is tackling the technical debt.

We get sick, but we don't ignore our health. We visit the doctor. The same applies to technical debt. We should work to correct it to provide a valuable product. The code is useless when no one uses it.
