# Srecko Kostic - Experiments

Srecko Kostic's collection of learning, practice, and self-reflection.

My self-improvement history. I am generally curious.

I have not committed to a specific domain because I am still searching for one to fire me up.

## Experiments

- [JavaScript](./javascript)
- [C++](./cpp)
- [Python](./python)
- [PowerShell](./powershell)
- [Docker](./docker)
- [Sandbox](./sandbox)

## Advices

- [Data Structures and Algorithms advice](https://qr.ae/pylUlM)
- [Data Structures and Algorithms usefulness](https://qr.ae/pylUuM)

**_If you think something is stupid, ridiculous, makes no sense, or anything remotely similar, research and learn it extensively. It will make sense._**

I used to think that unit tests are stupid, testers should test the software. I didn't know anything about unit tests.

I used to think Data Structures and Algorithms are stupid and algorithmic problems are ridiculous waste of time. They are not real programming, they are not how you write real software. I didn't know anything about any of them.

Every time I thought how something is stupid, ridiculous, makes no sense, or anything remotely similar, I did not agree with those opinions once I learned about it.

## Motivation

I started around three years ago to work on different topics. I did all the work in a directory on my pc, but it became unmanageable. The idea of doing something cool every day drove me. I realized I didn't share anything, and because of that, most of it is useless, forgotten, or abandoned. That is sad because I love some of those projects.

Working on this repository is among one the best decisions I made. I discovered so much thanks to it. I can never know the beast an initial idea will develop into.
