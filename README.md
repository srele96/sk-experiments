# Srecko Kostic - Experiments

Srecko Kostic's collection of experiments and reading topic wishlist in form of issues. This repository puts it all together.

I start to like this repository. It serves as a history and a tool to reflect. I can see how much I've improved.

## Experiments

- [JavaScript](./javascript)
- [C++](./cpp)
- [Python](./python)

## Getting lost in details

It is interesting how I am afraid to 'get lost' in the topic. Still, I always start researching interesting side details. For example, I decided to do a quick and dirty implementation of Kruskal's algorithm an hour ago at 10 pm, and currently, it is 11:10 pm. I am trying to make an implementation decision on whether I should loop over the two-dimensional matrix representing the graph using iterators, std::algorithm, for loop, or some other way that is the best practice. Remember that I wanted to do a 'quick' and 'dirty' implementation of the algorithm, so the best approach here doesn't matter. How did I get here?

It happens every time I take anything to work. For example, I started to play World of Warcraft around 6 pm and decided to level up quickly from 60 to 70. So I bought Dragonflight expansion and wanted a pleasant experience, go through quests and content, and do some stuff they have available. Then, sometime between 9:30 pm and 10 pm, I caught myself thinking about whether I wanted to complete the quest campaign for achievement, thinking if I wished to complete all quests in the zone, completely forgetting that I wanted to go through the main content, and side-quests aren't necessary.

Is this habit good or bad? It happens when I am studying. For example, when I start reading an interesting book, I google that term and read the explanation. If I find something interesting there, I will do the same, enter an infinite loop searching for attractive terms, and get lost in details.

Another example is I remember asking my professor something about the java implementation of the hash map. I was working on a problem he gave us, but I discovered I could enter the hash map implementation. Something in there caught my eye, so I asked him about it. While working on a task, I lost myself reading the implementation of the hash map.

I don't think this habit is bad because I get work done, progress, study well, and have a job; when I asked the professor four to five years ago, I still do it.

Thinking back about that, that's what made me good at programming. I got obsessed with a new intriguing concept, and my mind wrapped around it. That purposeful practice helped me remember and hone my skills in that topic. I find myself entering the mode of purposeful practice simply out of curiosity, naive interest, and the idea sounding good. It isn't something I enforce, but it happens merely, like thinking, what will I watch next on Netflix, just for studying or whatever I am doing?

That's what everyone does, find something entertaining to do until it's not, then find something else. So, why has it helped me become a better programmer? I don't know if I am a good programmer. People around me at work tell me so, but I find it hard to believe and am always looking for proof. I am trying to embody the definition of behavior that helps me improve. I want to share it and, more importantly, define it so I can take it and further improve it. To work on it, I need to define it, and to shape it as I wish, it has to be concrete and well-defined. I feel I am doing it right, whatever I'm doing now, but I need to know why.

### Conclusion

That's it. I need to document my thoughts and have a history so I can look back, reflect and use it as a foundation for my self-research. Only I can document my progress, steps, and everything I have done, perform research, and leave traces behind me. There are standardized research facilities for many scientific areas. Still, only I can research myself and my behavior to improve further.

## Motivation

I started around three years ago to work on different topics. I did all the work in a directory on my pc, but it became unmanageable. The idea of doing something cool every day drove me. I realized I didn't share anything, and most of it is useless, forgotten, or abandoned. That is sad because I love some of those projects.

This repository started small and grew until it had a couple of projects, and each of them had node_modules or some weird setup.

## Lessons

Technical debt is inevitable, but that is fine. The good behavior of computer scientists is tackling technical debt.

We get sick, but we don't ignore our health. We visit the doctor. The same applies to technical debt. We should work to correct it to provide a valuable product. The code is useless when no one uses it.
