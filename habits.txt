quality of life depends on quality of habits

atomic habit (small, manageable, repeatable)

to write the g reat book, you must become a book (mental representation of the book)

right reward or punishment may greatly influence how a person behave

broke down everything and improve by 1% and assemble it, you can get marginal results, tour de france cyclists

as small improvements accumulated, larger improvements came faster (my previous year)

success is a product of daily habits, shifting a plane trajectory by an inch, will get it to a completely different destination
focus on daily trajectory instead of results, have i stayed on the path today? am i going towards a destination?

outcome is a lagging measure of series of habbits, you get what you repeat
follow the curve of tiny wins or losses
how do they compound?
habits compound for you or against you

breakthrough is an outcome of compound actions
the most powerful outcomes are delayed, they are the result of compound results

build a habit to enjoy the process that compounds a powerful outcome

set goal (where do i want to get?), follow process (to reach the goal)
fall in love with the process, enjoy the every day things
set the goal and fall in love with the process, follow the process and it takes you to the goal

why do people put every day extraodinary amount of effort? perhaps because they identify with the effort
follow process that identifies me, "no thanks i am not a smoker", create identity
"i am passionate reader",
"i am passionate about study",
"i am proud of what i do",
intrinsic motivation, a habit becomes part of my identity, __I_AM_WHAT_I_DO__

DECIDE THE TYPE OF PERSON I WANT TO BE? - Who do I want to become?
PROVE IT TO MYSELF WITH SMALL WINS
  (sometimes this is hard, so i can work backwards from the goal to who do need to be to reach that goal)
  (cast away thoughts like
    - i am not fit for a director
    - i am not a leader
    - i am not fit to do a business
    - i am not a singer
    - i am not a youtuber
    - ...
