## Update

Through reading of [paul's online notes](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/Alg/DividingPolynomials.aspx) I realized that through my learning of mathematics 7 years ago wasn't fruitful. I could learn the problems and how to solve them, but I could solve only problems I solved with my math teacher. Two years ago when I started learning and reflecting on my learning experience, solving various algorithmic problems, reading about programming, learning various topics that feel difficult and cause confusion, I realized I was learning incorrectly. Now I want to create as much context when learning new stuff. Do not get bound by any limitations of a certain topic and how I have to learn the topic at all. I can start and quit any time I want. I realized that through contextualizing various difficult concepts I can learn them. Make them my own, think about them, etc...
