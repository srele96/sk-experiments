Prove the following identities:

```math
\sin^4 \alpha + \cos^2 \alpha + \sin^2 \alpha \cos^2 \alpha = 1
```

As I was looking at the expression I realized if I split out the $\sin^4 \alpha$ to $\sin^2 \alpha \sin^2 \alpha$ and then looked at the remainder of an expression and realized:

```math
\begin{align*}

\sin^2 \alpha \sin^2 \alpha + \sin^2 \alpha \cos^2 \alpha + \cos^2 \alpha = 1\\

\sin^2 (\sin^2 \alpha + \cos^2 \alpha) + \cos^2 \alpha = 1\\

\sin^2 \alpha + \cos^2 \alpha = 1\\

1 = 1

\end{align*}
```

Pure algebraic manipulation!

Aside from that...

```math
\begin{align*}
\frac{\sin \alpha}{1 - \cos \alpha} = \frac{1 + \cos \alpha}{\sin \alpha}\\
\frac{\sin \alpha}{1 - \cos \alpha} - \frac{1 + \cos \alpha}{\sin \alpha} = 0
\\
\frac{\sin^2 \alpha - (1 + \cos \alpha)(1 - \cos \alpha)}{(1 - \cos \alpha) \sin \alpha} = 0
\\
\frac{\sin^2 \alpha - 1 + \cos^2 \alpha}{(1 - \cos \alpha) \sin \alpha} = 0
\\
\frac{1 - 1}{(1 - \cos \alpha) \sin \alpha} = 0
\\
0 = 0
\end{align*}
```

I started only a month ago, yet I feel quite bad for inability to solve these problems in a matter of seconds. It took me like half an hour for each of these problems looking at formulas and displaying a problem in different states to notice what algebraic transformation to apply.
