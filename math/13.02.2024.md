Prove the following identities:

```math
\sin^4 \alpha + \cos^2 \alpha + \sin^2 \alpha \cos^2 \alpha = 1
```

As I was looking at the expression I realized if I split out the $\sin^4 \alpha$ to $\sin^2 \alpha \sin^2 \alpha$ and then looked at the remainder of an expression and realized:

```math
\sin^2 \alpha \sin^2 \alpha + \sin^2 \alpha \cos^2 \alpha + \cos^2 \alpha = 1\\

\sin^2 (\sin^2 \alpha + \cos^2 \alpha) + \cos^2 \alpha = 1\\

\sin^2 \alpha + \cos^2 \alpha = 1\\

1 = 1

\displaylines{\\x = a + b \\ y = b + c\\}
\displaylines{\\x = a + b \\ y = b + c\\}
```

Pure algebraic manipulation!

```math
\begin{align}

\sin^2 (\sin^2 \alpha + \cos^2 \alpha) &+ \cos^2 \alpha = 1 \\

\sin^2 (1) &+ \cos^2 \alpha = 1

\end{align}
```
