Prove the following identities:

```math
\sin^4 \alpha + \cos^2 \alpha + \sin^2 \alpha \cos^2 \alpha = 1
```

As I was looking at the expression I realized if I split out the $\sin^4 \alpha$ to $\sin^2 \alpha \sin^2 \alpha$ and then looked at the remainder of an expression and realized:

```math
\begin{align*}

\sin^2 \alpha \sin^2 \alpha + \sin^2 \alpha \cos^2 \alpha + \cos^2 \alpha = 1\\

\sin^2 (\sin^2 \alpha + \cos^2 \alpha) + \cos^2 \alpha = 1\\

\sin^2 \alpha + \cos^2 \alpha = 1\\

1 = 1

\end{align*}
```

Pure algebraic manipulation!
