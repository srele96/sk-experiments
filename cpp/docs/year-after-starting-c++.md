# Year after starting C++

It is date `July 04. 2023` and time `00:16`. I became interested in C++ and computer graphics in `August 2023` and created a [roadmap](https://github.com/srele96/sk-experiments/issues/123). The most of my focus was on C++ and some on computer graphics concepts.

I became comfortable with some constructs of C++ through hours of practice within this self-research repository and out of it. I believe I saved most of the practice on C++ except the code I deleted or refactored to make it better.

A year ago I wanted to have ideas on what to play with from C++ and the problem was that I didn't know what does the language offer, so I couldn't. With time, hours, and effort I got some ideas on what to practice. Currently when I think about C++ or computer graphics I have ideas on what to practice. I also practiced some mathematical concepts and the same applies to math too.

So far it looks like it takes me a journey long a year where I may do different topics and get comfortable with them.

I created my own way of practice. I didn't build a project using C++ yet I learned individual language features and got comfortable with them. That allowed me to comfortably use the features of the language that I've learned. Using different methods of practice yield different results. I should build a C++ project because it is also a kind of practice that will yield results that I may not have necessarily achieved so far.

It took me approximately a year of practice and effort to reach a stage where I was comfortable with a language as complicated as C++. I wanted to learn the language and didn't want to fix errors that I didn't know what they refer to. The solution was to take isolated features and get used to them individually. Over time I combined them and experimented with their behavior. I googled errors that I didn't know how to fix and learning path was mostly smooth yet challenging.
