# Understand beginners

I just opened the first [commit of the C++ experiments directory](https://github.com/srele96/sk-experiments/commit/bef81d22b5b19363f93bd89c3bbc3b0b2c5b3cd1) and remembered how I felt back then. Wow, that's a lot of flashbacks at once.

## Story

C++ experiments were born on August 24th, 2022. It took me more than a day or two to get the clang-format on my computer. Now that I think of it, I had questions like:

- What should I use to format?
- Why do I need to download an executable to format files?
- Why do I need an executable at all?
- Is everything in the C++ world done using executables?

I didn't know how to get the executables I needed to do what I wanted to. I remember I couldn't even make MSYS2 work on my computer. It felt unfamiliar, uncomfortable, and foreign.

It almost feels nostalgic that the C++ experiments used to be empty back then. But now that I take a closer look at the stuff I've worked on in the past couple of months, I feel a sudden rush of excitement, which feels exhilarating.

## Origin of sk-experiments

I remember how small and empty this project used to be. I have a lot of feelings about this project. Starting date of this repository is symbolic, March 1st, 2022. Look at the [initial commit](https://github.com/srele96/sk-experiments/commit/7e26f6e0aa2490976308c2e4337690d50bdfb5c2). Look at that quote:

> A lot of my experiments aren't complete projects. I realized I could have a collection of ideas bundled together.

I still love messing around with sample ideas and digging deep. I love taking a look inside and dissecting stuff. Look at the concept of `sk-experiments`!

I remember how terrified I was when I saw GitHub and README files. I didn't know how to use either of them. However, I've become proficient in using Notepad, Notepad++, and README files for writing code, ideas, and other stuff.

Recently I held a presentation and used Notepad to show some ideas and examples. A guy commented how I must be using Notepad quite a lot, to which I replied: Is it that noticeable?

He spoke the truth. I use Notepad a lot for code or anything else.

## Purpose of this repository

I love doing small stuff, and I hate abandoning it. I have a directory on my computer full of sample ideas and things I have tried out. I'm not too fond of the fact that they are there, abandoned and left to rot. None will see them.

This repository can bring me back to when I was doing each experiment. I can reflect and feel how I used to be back then. This repository is the ultimate collection of some ideas I've had. Sadly I can't fit all of them in this repository because there are too many. I can, but then the repository will be full of text.

After all, that is why I have `TOPICS.md`, which I haven't touched for a while. I used that list to write articles about things that make me curious.

I'm using the `docs` part of each experiment as docs for conclusions, observations, ideas, and anything else related to the topic but textual.

This repository helps me escape from reality, a time travel tool, a collection of work and ideas, and a collection of things I enjoy doing.

Among all ideas was that I wanted to share a reusable setup for various experiments. I am glad I didn't know about the GitHub template repository back then. I could've used a template repository for all of that. A friend suggested that I make a separate repository for each experiment because GitHub is that. A collection of repositories, and each repository is a project, experiment, idea, or whatever.

In the end, this repository helps me remember what I used to think before I learned the concept. It helps me remember things that used to feel unfamiliar were the problems when I didn't know what to do. It helps me understand my previous mindset when I didn't know something I was trying to do.
