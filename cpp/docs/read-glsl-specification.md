# Read OpenGL Shading Language - GLSL specification

Here is a link to [GLSLandSpec 4.60](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL/specs/gl/GLSLangSpec.4.60.pdf).

## Story

I was attempting to reinforce my knowledge of computer graphics concepts and how they work together. I feel like I am highly ambitious because I am learning OpenGL and not game engines which hide much of the concepts used for building them.

However, I have a dream of designing a game engine in the way I see fit and be able to play with it as I wish to. I had a question of which version of GLSL should I define when writing shaders. I asked ChatGPT about it and he told me that hardware determines which version of GLSL is supported. It is bound to OpenGL implementation and the creators of computer graphics implement the opengl specification.
