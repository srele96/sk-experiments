# Important concepts

- Build project: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/guide/tutorial/
- Use library: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2749733/how-to-add-libraries-in-c
  - Static: .a or .lib
  - Dynamic: .so or .dll

## Why are they important

I need to use a library to create any useful program.

To use a library, I need to download it.

To download it, I can download and compile it myself or use build system to do
it for me.

I need to use a library when I download it. That is a problem, because I don't
know how to include it.

Those are blockers, and I'm not in a hurry.
