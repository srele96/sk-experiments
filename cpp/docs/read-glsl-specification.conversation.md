how do i choose version for glsl? for example: #version 330 core

To choose a version for GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language), you use the #version preprocessor directive. The directive is used to specify the GLSL version that you want to use.

For example, if you want to use version 3.3 of GLSL, you would use the following directive at the beginning of your shader code:

```arduino
# version 330
```

The core part of the directive is optional, but it is typically used to indicate that you are using the core profile of OpenGL. This is the default profile for OpenGL 3.2 and later, and it provides a more modern and streamlined API compared to the compatibility profile.

It's important to choose a GLSL version that is compatible with your OpenGL context. You can check the supported GLSL versions by querying the GL_SHADING_LANGUAGE_VERSION parameter using glGetString(). You can also check the OpenGL version by querying the GL_VERSION parameter.

when am i allowed to call glGetString?

You can call glGetString() after you have created a valid OpenGL context. It is generally called after initializing GLEW or any other OpenGL loading library, since these libraries must create an OpenGL context before they can load the OpenGL function pointers. Once you have a valid OpenGL context, you can call glGetString() to query various types of information about the OpenGL implementation, such as the version number, vendor, and renderer.

opengl calls graphics drivers, right? the version user has depends on the graphics card he owns, correct?

Yes, that's correct. OpenGL is implemented by graphics drivers provided by GPU vendors, and the version of OpenGL that is available depends on the graphics hardware and the driver installed on the user's system. Different graphics cards may support different versions of OpenGL, and even if two cards support the same version of OpenGL, there may be differences in their performance and feature support.

if my glsl version is 4.60, which glsl can i use?

If your GLSL version is 4.60, you can use any GLSL version up to 4.60. You can specify the GLSL version you want to use at the beginning of your shader code using the "#version" directive. For example, if you want to use GLSL version 4.60, you would add the following line to the top of your shader code:

```arduino
# version 460
```

This tells the OpenGL driver to use GLSL version 4.60 when compiling your shader code.

Srećko Kostić

ah... so its a number without a dot

Yes, that's correct! The version number for GLSL is an integer, without a dot. For example, GLSL version 4.60 is written as #version 460.

Srećko Kostić

if i specify version 360, it means i can use highest version 360 or minimum version?

If you specify version 360, it means you are requesting at least version 3.60 of the GLSL language. This means that you can use any version of GLSL that is equal to or greater than 3.60, including version 4.60. However, you cannot use any features that are introduced in GLSL versions higher than the version you specified.

which shaders are programmable by programmer? there are some stages, vertex processing, tesselation control, tesselation evaluation, geometry, fragment and compute?

That's correct! The following shader stages are programmable by the programmer in modern versions of OpenGL:

- Vertex shader: This shader processes each vertex of a 3D model and is responsible for transforming the vertex positions from object space to screen space.
- Tesselation control shader: This shader is part of the tesselation pipeline and is responsible for controlling the level of tesselation of a patch of vertices.
- Tesselation evaluation shader: This shader is also part of the tesselation pipeline and is responsible for generating the final vertices based on the tesselation level set by the control shader.
- Geometry shader: This shader is optional and can be used to generate additional geometry, such as creating a billboard or extruding a mesh.
- Fragment shader: This shader processes each fragment of a 3D model and is responsible for computing the final color of the fragment.
- Compute shader: This shader is used for general-purpose computation on the GPU and can be used for tasks such as physics simulations, image processing, or machine learning.

Keep in mind that not all stages are required for every rendering operation, and some stages may be skipped if they are not needed.

show me some example code for compute shader

Sure! Here's an example of a simple compute shader that adds two arrays element-wise and stores the result in a third array:

```glsl
#version 430

layout(local_size_x = 1, local_size_y = 1, local_size_z = 1) in;

layout(std430, binding = 0) buffer A {
    int data[];
} a;

layout(std430, binding = 1) buffer B {
    int data[];
} b;

layout(std430, binding = 2) buffer C {
    int data[];
} c;

void main() {
    uint i = gl_GlobalInvocationID.x;
    c.data[i] = a.data[i] + b.data[i];
}
```

In this example, we use the layout keyword to specify the size of the local work group (in this case, 1x1x1) and the layout of the input and output buffers. The gl_GlobalInvocationID variable provides the index of the current thread, which we use to index into the input arrays and store the result in the output array.

To use this shader in an OpenGL program, we would first compile and link it like any other shader program, and then dispatch it with the appropriate parameters using the glDispatchCompute function. Here's an example of how we might use it to add two arrays of 100 integers:

```cpp
// create and bind input and output buffer objects
GLuint a, b, c;
glCreateBuffers(1, &a);
glNamedBufferStorage(a, 100 * sizeof(int), nullptr, GL_MAP_WRITE_BIT);
glCreateBuffers(1, &b);
glNamedBufferStorage(b, 100 * sizeof(int), nullptr, GL_MAP_WRITE_BIT);
glCreateBuffers(1, &c);
glNamedBufferStorage(c, 100 * sizeof(int), nullptr, GL_MAP_READ_BIT);

// fill input buffers with data
int* a_data = reinterpret_cast<int*>(glMapNamedBuffer(a, GL_WRITE_ONLY));
int* b_data = reinterpret_cast<int*>(glMapNamedBuffer(b, GL_WRITE_ONLY));
for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
    a_data[i] = i;
    b_data[i] = i * i;
}
glUnmapNamedBuffer(a);
glUnmapNamedBuffer(b);

// create and bind shader program
GLuint program = glCreateProgram();
GLuint shader = glCreateShader(GL_COMPUTE_SHADER);
glShaderSource(shader, 1, &shader_code, nullptr);
glCompileShader(shader);
glAttachShader(program, shader);
glLinkProgram(program);
glUseProgram(program);

// bind input and output buffers to shader program
glBindBufferBase(GL_SHADER_STORAGE_BUFFER, 0, a);
glBindBufferBase(GL_SHADER_STORAGE_BUFFER, 1, b);
glBindBufferBase(GL_SHADER_STORAGE_BUFFER, 2, c);

// dispatch compute shader
glDispatchCompute(100, 1, 1);

// wait for computation to finish
glMemoryBarrier(GL_SHADER_STORAGE_BARRIER_BIT);

// read output buffer data
int* c_data = reinterpret_cast<int*>(glMapNamedBuffer(c, GL_READ_ONLY));
for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
    std::cout << c_data[i] << std::endl;
}
glUnmapNamedBuffer(c);
```

In this example, we first create and bind input and output buffer objects using the glCreateBuffers and glNamedBufferStorage functions. We then fill the input buffers with data using the glMapNamedBuffer and glUnmapNamedBuffer functions.

Next, we create and link the compute shader program using the glCreateProgram, `

does it mean mining of cryptocurrencies is done using compute shader?

Yes, mining of some cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, uses compute shaders. The mining process involves performing complex mathematical calculations repeatedly, which can be efficiently done using the parallel processing capabilities of graphics cards. Compute shaders can be used to implement these calculations on the GPU, resulting in faster mining performance.

Srećko Kostić

so who implemented the program that uses compute shaders for that? ethereum group? or someone else?

The implementation of the program that uses compute shaders for cryptocurrency mining can vary. The specific code used for mining depends on the particular cryptocurrency being mined and the mining software being used. There are several mining software available, some of which are developed by the cryptocurrency developers themselves, while others are developed by third-party developers. For example, for Ethereum mining, some popular mining software include Claymore, PhoenixMiner, and Gminer.

Srećko Kostić

do they use compute shaders?

Yes, cryptocurrency mining operations often use compute shaders to perform the highly parallel computations required for mining. These operations typically involve solving complex mathematical problems in order to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. Compute shaders are well-suited for these types of tasks because they allow for massively parallel processing on the GPU, which can greatly accelerate the rate at which these computations are performed.

why is tesselation control processing used?

Tessellation is the process of breaking down complex geometries into smaller, more manageable pieces for rendering. The tesselation control shader (also called the hull shader) is one of the programmable stages of the OpenGL pipeline that allows the programmer to specify how tesselation should occur.

The tesselation control shader is responsible for generating control points that define the tesselated patch, as well as providing information such as the tesselation level (how much to tesselate), and how to interpolate the control points to generate the vertices of the tesselated patch.

In summary, the tesselation control shader is used to define the properties of the tesselation process and generate the control points that define the tesselated geometry.

Srećko Kostić

where can Tessellation Control Processor be applied? why is it good? why is it bad? what problems does it solve?

Tessellation Control Processor (TCP) is a programmable stage in the OpenGL graphics pipeline, responsible for determining how a high-level patch will be subdivided into smaller patches for further processing by the Tessellation Evaluation Processor (TEP). It is part of the tessellation stage, which allows for the dynamic generation of new geometry based on a high-level description.

One of the key benefits of using TCP is that it allows for more efficient use of geometry processing resources. Instead of processing a large number of individual objects or polygons, tessellation allows for a smaller number of high-level patches to be used to describe a more complex object. These patches can then be subdivided into smaller patches to provide additional detail where needed. This reduces the overall amount of geometry processing required, which can lead to improved performance and reduced memory usage.

TCP can be applied in a variety of contexts, including game development, scientific visualization, and architectural design. For example, it can be used to dynamically generate terrain or other natural environments, or to add detail to complex architectural models. TCP is also useful in generating smooth curves and surfaces, which can be difficult to achieve with traditional polygon-based methods.

One potential downside to using TCP is that it can be computationally expensive. Subdividing a large number of patches can require a significant amount of processing power, which can be a limiting factor in certain applications. Additionally, tessellation can introduce new challenges related to maintaining smoothness and consistency across patch boundaries, which can require careful management and attention to detail.

Overall, TCP is a powerful tool for generating complex geometry in real-time applications. While it may not be appropriate for every situation, it can provide significant benefits in terms of performance, efficiency, and visual quality when used effectively.

what is tesselation in opengl terms and on conceptual level and what does it solve?

Tessellation is a technique in computer graphics used to increase the level of detail in a 3D object without having to increase the number of vertices in the original mesh. The process involves breaking down a larger polygonal surface into smaller ones, which can then be used to create a more detailed surface.

In OpenGL terms, tessellation is implemented through the use of tessellation shaders. The tessellation process consists of two stages: the tessellation control shader, which specifies how the original polygons should be subdivided, and the tessellation evaluation shader, which generates the new vertices for the subdivided polygons.

Tessellation can be applied in various ways, such as to create more detailed curves and surfaces in 3D models, or to dynamically adapt the level of detail in a scene based on the distance between the camera and objects. Tessellation can also be used to create displacement mapping, where the tessellation shader modifies the vertex positions of a mesh based on a texture map, resulting in more realistic surface features such as bumps and wrinkles.

One of the main advantages of tessellation is that it can help reduce the computational cost of rendering complex scenes, as it allows for more efficient use of available resources. However, tessellation can also introduce some challenges, such as requiring more memory to store the additional vertices, and potentially causing artifacts or errors if not used properly.
