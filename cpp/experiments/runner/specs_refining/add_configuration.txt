try to support JSON, YAML, TOML configuration files

add configuration
how to add configuration? how does the command look like?

create configuration file for the user with his project directory path
run commands from the configuration file

runner config add <path>

runner config add ./config_file
runner config add ./path/to/config_file
runner config add ../config_file
runner config add config_file
runner config add C:/Users/John/config_file

what does the runner do with the config?
does it save path?
does it read config from the path and save it locally?
