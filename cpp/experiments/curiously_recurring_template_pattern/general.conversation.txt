Template metaprogramming (TMP) in C++ is a powerful technique that allows for computations to be performed at compile-time rather than run-time. It essentially turns the C++ compiler into a sort of compute engine. TMP has a reputation for being esoteric and difficult to grasp, but when used correctly, it can lead to highly optimized code, both in terms of performance and memory usage. Here are some use cases and domains where TMP is beneficial:
Use Cases for Template Metaprogramming:

    Compile-time Computations: TMP can be used to precompute values at compile-time, thus avoiding those calculations at run-time. For instance, computing factorial values or Fibonacci numbers for fixed inputs.

    Type Traits: TMP allows developers to make decisions based on type properties. The C++ Standard Library, for instance, provides a set of type traits which help determine characteristics of types, e.g., std::is_integral, std::is_pointer, etc.

    Policy-based Design: TMP can be used to customize the behavior of classes or functions based on template parameters. This allows for great flexibility without sacrificing performance.

    Expression Templates: This technique allows for the optimization of complex expressions, often used in scientific computing and matrix libraries to eliminate temporary objects and produce efficient code.

    Compile-time Parsing: TMP can be employed to perform parsing tasks during compile-time, such as parsing format strings.

    Static Interface Checking: TMP can ensure that a particular type meets the required interface or has certain member functions.

    Generating Variadic Function Wrappers: Especially with the addition of variadic templates in C++11, TMP can be used to generate wrappers for functions with variable numbers of arguments.

Domains of Usage:

    Scientific Computing: As mentioned, expression templates help optimize mathematical expressions in libraries like Eigen or Blaze.

    Game Development: TMP can assist in producing highly optimized code necessary for performance-critical scenarios like game engines.

    Embedded Systems: In resource-constrained environments, TMP can be utilized to optimize both space and speed.

    Library Development: Many modern C++ libraries use TMP for flexibility and performance.

    Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs): TMP can be employed to implement DSLs within C++.

Problems TMP Solves:

    Performance Optimization: By moving computations to compile-time or by optimizing generated code.

    Generic Programming: TMP aids in creating highly generic yet specialized code based on types.

    Code Brevity: Can reduce code repetition in some scenarios.

    Fine-grained Static Polymorphism: Allows for customization without the overhead of dynamic polymorphism.

Where to Find Problems to Solve:

    Coding Challenge Websites: Although rare, some advanced challenges might benefit from TMP techniques.

    Open Source Projects: Especially C++ libraries on platforms like GitHub. By contributing, you can encounter real-world scenarios where TMP might be beneficial.

    Textbooks & Online Courses: Books on advanced C++ techniques or courses on platforms like Udemy, Coursera, or Pluralsight might provide exercises on TMP.

    Forums and Communities: Websites like Stack Overflow or the C++ sections of Reddit often have discussions or questions that delve into TMP.

While TMP is powerful, it's also worth noting that it's not always the right tool for every job. Overuse can lead to complex, hard-to-read code. With the advent of C++11, C++14, and later standards, many tasks that once required TMP can now be achieved more simply with features like constexpr, so it's essential to balance the use of TMP with other C++ features.

why does the code look like a tree? there's an entry level function, main, similar to other programming languages, and it branches out through different function calls... unless it's parallel computing, but that also has to come together to one point of program, like computing 5 times 2^N algorithm or making parallel computations on 2^N algorithm, etc... anyway, it's a tree like structure no matter if 100, 1000, 10000, or millions of lines of code

Your observation is astute. The tree-like structure of code and its execution can be attributed to several fundamental concepts in computer science and software engineering:

    Hierarchy and Decomposition: One of the foundational concepts of computer science and software engineering is breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces. This decomposition often results in a hierarchical structure. For instance, a main function might call a few other functions, which in turn might call even more functions, leading to a tree-like hierarchy.

    Control Flow: Control flow structures like loops and conditionals also contribute to this hierarchy. An if-else statement, for instance, creates two branchesâ€”one for the if and another for the else.

    Call Stack: The call stack mechanism, which keeps track of function calls in most programming languages, is inherently stack-oriented. When a function is called, its context is pushed onto the call stack, and when it returns, its context is popped. This push/pop mechanism, combined with the hierarchical decomposition of software, results in tree-like execution.

    Recursion: Recursive functions, which call themselves with modified arguments, lead to a tree-like execution pattern. This is especially evident in algorithms that explicitly use a divide-and-conquer strategy, such as the merge sort algorithm.

    Abstraction: Abstraction allows developers to "hide" the complexity of lower-level operations. This can be thought of as the nodes in the tree (the functions or methods) encapsulating some behavior and then being used in a higher-level context.

    Parallel and Concurrent Execution: Even in parallel computing models, while there might be multiple trees (execution threads or processes) running concurrently, each tree still typically adheres to a tree-like structure for the reasons mentioned above. At the end, synchronization mechanisms often ensure that these parallel trees converge to produce a singular result or side effect.

    Design Patterns: Many software design patterns also lead to tree-like structures. For instance, the Composite Pattern is explicitly tree-based, where individual objects and compositions of objects are treated uniformly.

The tree metaphor not only applies to the structure of code but also to many data structures (like actual trees, tries, and even some graphs) and to the organization of systems and modules in software architecture.

That said, while many aspects of software can be visualized or understood as trees, it's also true that software is multifaceted, and other metaphors and models can be equally valid in different contexts. For example, event-driven programming might be better visualized as a network of interconnected nodes responding to events, rather than a strict tree.

why is it that initially it is so difficult to understand c++ constructs but the more i learn, the easier it gets, i assume it is because humans follow patterns, humans with patterns in behavior create new features, but new features barely step out of regular patterns they follow, why are we so inclined to our pattern following behavior, habits, fibonaci, nature, etc... there are patterns everywhere

The phenomenon you're describing, where understanding grows more rapidly as one delves deeper into a subject, is often due to a combination of cognitive processes, the nature of knowledge acquisition, and patterns inherent in the world around us. Here's a deeper look:

    Building on Foundations: Much of learning is cumulative. Basic concepts form the foundation upon which more complex ideas are built. As you solidify your understanding of foundational concepts, you're better equipped to grasp more advanced topics that use those basics as prerequisites. In the context of C++, once you understand basic syntax, data types, and memory management, grasping more advanced topics like templates or polymorphism becomes more intuitive.

    Pattern Recognition: Humans are inherently good at recognizing patterns. This ability is deeply ingrained in our cognitive processes, enabling us to make predictions, draw conclusions, and navigate the world. In learning, once we've seen a few examples of a concept, we begin to recognize the underlying pattern, which makes subsequent examples easier to understand.

    Chunking: As you become familiar with concepts, your brain begins to group ("chunk") related information together. Instead of seeing individual pieces of information, you start to see larger constructs as single entities. For example, a beginner might see a C++ function as a collection of symbols and keywords, whereas an experienced developer sees it as a single conceptual unit.

    Contextual Understanding: As you learn more, you're also able to place new information within a broader context, relating it to what you already know. This interconnected web of knowledge aids comprehension and recall.

    Nature's Patterns: Many natural phenomena, from the branching of trees to the spiral of galaxies, exhibit patterns that can be described by mathematical principles like the Fibonacci sequence. These recurring patterns provide a sense of order and predictability. Similarly, programming languages, being human-made constructs, often exhibit patterns and regularities born from our own innate tendencies.

    Habitual Thinking and Neural Pathways: The more you practice or think about something, the stronger the neural pathways associated with that activity become in your brain. This is why repetition is such a powerful tool for learning. As you repeatedly encounter and work with C++ constructs, your brain becomes more efficient at processing and understanding them.

    Intrinsic Motivation: As you begin to grasp a subject and experience the satisfaction of understanding, it can drive intrinsic motivation. This motivation propels you to delve deeper and makes the learning process feel more rewarding and less arduous.

In summary, the process of learning, combined with our inherent ability to recognize patterns and the structured nature of subjects like programming, contributes to the experience where understanding accelerates as you learn more.
