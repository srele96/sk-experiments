why does sfinae use ::type member of a struct? whats the purpose?

SFINAE, which stands for "Substitution Failure Is Not An Error", is a principle in C++ template metaprogramming. It essentially means that if a substitution of template parameters into a template fails, it's not an immediate error. Instead, the compiler simply discards that particular template from the set of potential candidates.

The use of ::type (often via a typedef or a using declaration inside a struct or class template) is common in SFINAE-based techniques because it provides a straightforward way to trigger a substitution failure.

The idea is to craft a type trait or some metafunction that will have a ::type member if a condition is true and won't have it if the condition is false.

Here's a simple example using the older typedef style:

cpp

template<typename T>
struct has_typedef_foo {
private:
    // Two helper structs with different sizes.
    typedef char one;
    typedef long two;

    // Test if U::foo is a valid type.
    template<typename U>
    static one test(typename U::foo*);

    template<typename U>
    static two test(...);  // Ellipsis will match any argument.

public:
    // If the "one" version of test() was chosen, value will be true.
    // Otherwise, it will be false.
    static const bool value = sizeof(test<T>(nullptr)) == sizeof(one);
};

struct A { typedef int foo; };
struct B {};

static_assert(has_typedef_foo<A>::value, "A has typedef foo");
static_assert(!has_typedef_foo<B>::value, "B doesn't have typedef foo");

In modern C++ (C++11 and later), std::enable_if is often used in SFINAE contexts:

cpp

template<typename T, typename = void>
struct has_typedef_foo : std::false_type {};

template<typename T>
struct has_typedef_foo<T, typename std::enable_if<!std::is_void<typename T::foo>::value>::type> : std::true_type {};

struct A { typedef int foo; };
struct B {};

static_assert(has_typedef_foo<A>::value, "A has typedef foo");
static_assert(!has_typedef_foo<B>::value, "B doesn't have typedef foo");

In the above example, std::enable_if is a template that contains a ::type member (equivalent to std::enable_if<...>::type) only if its condition is true.

In SFINAE, the ::type member is crucial because it gives a straightforward mechanism to either make a type available or not, based on some condition. If ::type doesn't exist for some instantiation, it will lead to a substitution failure, which, as per the SFINAE rule, just means that the particular instantiation is ignored without producing an error.

so the failure to contain member ::type will make that template trigger sfinae and remove it?

Exactly! In the context of SFINAE, if the ::type member is not present for a particular instantiation of a template, it leads to a substitution failure.

When the compiler encounters a substitution failure in a valid SFINAE context, instead of producing a hard error, it simply discards (or ignores) that particular instantiation from the set of possible template specializations or overloads.

Here's a simple illustration:

cpp

template<typename T, typename = typename T::type>
void foo(T) {
    std::cout << "T has a 'type' member typedef or using.\n";
}

template<typename T>
void foo(...) {
    std::cout << "T doesn't have a 'type' member typedef or using.\n";
}

struct A { typedef int type; };
struct B {};

foo(A());  // Outputs: T has a 'type' member typedef or using.
foo(B());  // Outputs: T doesn't have a 'type' member typedef or using.

For foo(A()), the first overload of foo is a valid instantiation because A::type exists. For foo(B()), the first overload would lead to a substitution failure since B::type doesn't exist. However, due to SFINAE, this isn't an error. Instead, the compiler simply discards the first overload from consideration, and the second overload of foo (the ellipsis version) gets selected.

So, the absence of ::type triggers SFINAE, effectively "disqualifying" that instantiation or overload, allowing other potential matches to be considered.
