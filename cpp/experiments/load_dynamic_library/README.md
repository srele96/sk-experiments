# Load Dynamic Library

Write a dynamic library to figure out the essence of the concept.

- [Load manually from executable](./load_manually/)
- [Load using loader](./load_using_loader/)

Add ChatGPT discussion that helped me understand how to implement the concept.

## Self-Reflection

I am implementing importer for dynamic library and comparing it to libraries that I have seen in the wild: `glew`, `glfw`, ...

I am thinking how it was when I used to learn JavaScript. At one point I could come up with many solutions on my own. I believe it was maybe after 500-ish hours of studying and various projects that forced me to learn new things.

At that point I felt like I knew something because I could come up with solutions on my own and understand tutorials more easily.

After that I wanted to learn `Webpack` when I realized I don't know much because I couldn't comprehend what is its purpose as the whole idea of what it does was new to me. That reminds me of the time when I was learning Computer Graphics, shaders, uniforms, data transfer from cpu to gpu, etc...

Once I started working I realized the project uses a lot of things that I do not know. I also realized how weak I was at working with new things that I do not know. My solution was to learn everything there is so I am as prepared as possible.

After that I realized that there is too much to _"Learn everything"_, so I decided to improve my learning efficiency by learning how to learn.

Right now I realized how slow learning is and how long it takes to acquire a decent amount of knowledge. As Anders Ericson says if a profession is new, one can be an expert with as much as 50 hours of practice. For the old professions like Chess, it requires as much practice as the experts in the field have and even more.

Another thing I realize is how interconnected the knowledge has to be to be useful. For example programming skills will not translate if I decide to learn to sing. Maybe self analysis, self awareness, self reflection, and others... However I am starting from scratch.

In the C++ world everything feels like a novelty for me. I don't know the language as well as I desire. I don't know the techniques as well as I desire. My solutions look like those of a novice. However one thing I can initially do is learn everything I possibly can, implementing projects, until it becomes easy. Then I need to ramp up the difficulty and repeat the process. Over and over again...
