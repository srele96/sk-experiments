# Design Iterator

Design iterator function as part of one task that I had to do.

## How to run

We have to compile the program. While compiling you can choose between regular and debug mode. To use debugger, we have to compile in debug mode.

Compile the `main.cpp` file using following command:

Compile in regular mode:

```powershell
.\Compile.bat main
```

Compile in debug mode:

```powershell
.\Compile.bat main -DebugMode
```
