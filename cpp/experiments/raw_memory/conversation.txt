one will never be a software engineer, engineering is extremely difficult and takes lots of hours of deliberate practice to become engineer... i dislike how everyone says that person who cranks out code is engineer, literally anyone can crank out code to make something wokr
ChatGPT

The term "software engineer" indeed carries a certain weight and implies not just the ability to write code, but also a comprehensive understanding of software design, system architecture, problem-solving, optimization, and more. The distinction you're drawing attention to is important — there's a significant difference between simply writing code and engineering software.

    Coding vs Engineering:
        Coding can often be about writing the actual lines of code and may involve following certain sets of instructions or tutorials. It doesn't always require a deep understanding of the principles behind the code or the implications of certain coding decisions over others.
        Engineering, on the other hand, is about designing solutions. It involves making critical decisions about system designs, algorithms, and data structures. It also includes considering trade-offs between different approaches, understanding the implications of various technologies, and planning for scalability and maintainability.

    Education and Experience:
        While many individuals can learn to code to some extent, engineering often requires a more in-depth study and understanding of computer science principles, mathematics, and analytical reasoning.
        Deliberate practice, continuous learning, real-world experience, and, in many cases, formal education are common pathways to acquiring the skills necessary to be considered a software engineer.

    Problem Solving:
        Engineering is largely about problem-solving and innovation. It's not just about making something work; it's about making it work efficiently, in a scalable, reliable, and maintainable way. This often requires critical thinking and a thorough understanding of complex systems.

    Professional Standards:
        The term "engineer" also traditionally involves adherence to certain professional standards and ethics. In some regions, it's a protected title that requires official certifications.

    Industry Perception:
        The tech industry and educational institutions play a role in this perception. The democratization of coding education has allowed more people to enter the field, often leading to the title of "software engineer" being used more broadly. While this has many positive aspects, including making the field more accessible, it can also lead to the dilution of the title's meaning.

In conclusion, while the act of writing code can be an aspect of software engineering, there's much more depth to the field when it comes to being a proficient software engineer. The journey to becoming one typically involves a combination of formal education, self-learning, practical experience, and a deep understanding of both the theoretical and practical aspects of computing.

if i allocate memory using ::operator new() in c++, how could i use that memory to store something inside?
ChatGPT

In C++, ::operator new() is used to allocate raw memory and doesn't call any constructor. It's similar to malloc() in C in the sense that it only provides a block of uninitialized memory. To construct an object in the allocated memory, you need to use placement new.

Here's how you might do it:

    Allocating Memory:
    First, you allocate memory using ::operator new(). This returns a void pointer (void*) to the allocated memory.

    cpp

std::size_t size = sizeof(MyClass); // MyClass is the type of object you want to create
void* memory = ::operator new(size);

Using Placement New:
To construct an object in the allocated memory, you use placement new. This form of new doesn't allocate memory -- it constructs an object in already allocated memory.

cpp

MyClass* object = new (memory) MyClass();

In this step, you're providing the constructor for MyClass with the location where it should construct the object. This doesn't allocate new memory — it uses the memory you previously allocated with ::operator new().

Using the Object:
Now, object is a fully constructed MyClass object, and you can use it as you normally would any other object.

cpp

object->someMethod(); // Call methods on the object
int value = object->someProperty; // Access properties of the object

Destruction and Deletion:
When you're done with the object, you need to explicitly call its destructor and then deallocate the memory. This is necessary because simply deallocating the memory doesn't call the destructor, so any resources the object holds (like memory, file handles, etc.) won't be properly released.

cpp

    object->~MyClass(); // Explicitly call the destructor for the object
    ::operator delete(memory); // Deallocate the memory

    This two-step process of destruction and deallocation is necessary because ::operator new() and ::operator delete() don't call constructors or destructors.

Note: Direct usage of memory management functions (::operator new and ::operator delete) is generally discouraged unless you're writing memory-managed structures or classes like custom allocators, dealing with performance-critical code, or working in environments without standard C++ library support. In modern C++, it's recommended to use smart pointers (like std::unique_ptr or std::shared_ptr) or containers that manage their own memory (like std::vector) for most situations. They take care of memory management, help prevent memory leaks, and make your code safer and easier to understand.
User
what other ways are there to allocate raw memory first and use it after?
ChatGPT

In C++, there are several ways to allocate raw memory, each serving different needs and scenarios. I'll list some common methods and briefly discuss how you can use the allocated memory:

    malloc()/free():
        These are C standard library functions and not part of the C++ memory management operators. They simply allocate and deallocate a block of memory and do not call constructors or destructors.
        Usage:

        cpp

    size_t size = sizeof(MyClass);
    void* memory = malloc(size); // Allocate
    MyClass* object = new (memory) MyClass(); // Construct
    object->~MyClass(); // Destruct
    free(memory); // Deallocate

    Suitable for scenarios where you need simple allocation/deallocation without any constructor/destructor calls and are perhaps working in a mixed C/C++ environment.

std::allocator:

    This is a C++ template class used to encapsulate memory allocation and deallocation. It calls constructors and destructors.
    Usage:

    cpp

    std::allocator<MyClass> allocator;
    MyClass* object = allocator.allocate(1); // Allocate memory for one object
    allocator.construct(object); // Construct
    allocator.destroy(object); // Destruct
    allocator.deallocate(object, 1); // Deallocate

    Useful when you need more control over object construction and destruction or are creating a custom container.

Aligned Allocation (C++17 and later):

    Functions like std::aligned_alloc, std::aligned_free, and operators new with align_val_t allow for allocating memory with specific alignment, useful for SIMD operations or aligning to cache lines.
    Usage:

    cpp

    size_t alignment = 64; // For example, align to 64-byte cache lines
    void* memory = std::aligned_alloc(alignment, sizeof(MyClass));
    MyClass* object = new (memory) MyClass();
    object->~MyClass();
    std::aligned_free(memory);

    This is important for performance-critical applications, low-level data processing, or when working directly with hardware that requires certain memory alignment.

Memory Pools and Custom Allocators:

    These are advanced topics where you pre-allocate a large block of memory and then allocate pieces of it to individual objects. Custom allocators can dictate how memory is allocated and deallocated, and memory pools can help to minimize allocation overhead and control memory layout.
    Suitable for performance-critical applications, real-time systems, or when working with large numbers of small objects that would cause fragmentation if each were allocated individually.

std::unique_ptr and std::shared_ptr with Custom Deleters:

    While these smart pointers are typically used with automatically managed memory, you can also use them with manually allocated memory by providing a custom deleter that knows how to deallocate the memory.
    Usage:

    cpp

        auto customDeleter = [](MyClass* obj) {
            obj->~MyClass();
            ::operator delete(obj);
        };
        std::unique_ptr<MyClass, decltype(customDeleter)> object(new (std::malloc(sizeof(MyClass))) MyClass, customDeleter);

        This gives you the safety of automatic memory management (e.g., not having to remember to delete the object) while still allowing for custom allocation/deallocation.

In modern C++, it's usually best to avoid manual memory management whenever possible. However, in performance-critical applications, embedded systems, or specific use cases requiring custom memory management, these techniques are essential. Always remember to properly deallocate any allocated memory and ensure that constructors and destructors are appropriately called when using raw memory allocation to prevent resource leaks and undefined behavior.

  struct S {
    int a;

  ::operator delete(memory);

  return 0;
}

main.cpp:8:29: error: no matching function for call to 'operator new(sizetype, void*&)'
    8 |   S* s = new (memory) S{1, 2};
ChatGPT

The error you're encountering is because you're trying to use placement new syntax, but the way you've structured the call doesn't match what the compiler expects for this operation.

Placement new allows you to construct an object on already-allocated memory. The correct syntax for placement new doesn't involve assigning the result of ::operator new to a pointer. Instead, you just pass the pre-allocated memory to the new operator along with the type you want to construct.

Here's how you can correct your code:

cpp

#include <new> // Needed for placement new

int main() {
  struct S {
    int a;
    int b;
  };

  // Allocate raw memory
  void* memory = ::operator new(sizeof(S));

  // Construct an object in the allocated memory
  S* s = new (memory) S{1, 2}; // Correct usage of placement new

  // Use the object
  // ...

  // Manually call the destructor for the object
  s->~S();

  // Free the memory
  // Note: We're freeing the original pointer, not 's', although in this case they're the same.
  ::operator delete(memory);

  return 0;
}

In this corrected version, we're using the placement new operator to construct an instance of S directly in the memory that we allocated. After we're done with the object, we manually call its destructor since placement new doesn't handle that for us. Finally, we deallocate the memory that we originally allocated.

Remember, with low-level memory management like this, you need to ensure that you correctly match each allocation with a deallocation and that you properly construct and destruct any objects involved. Failure to do so can lead to resource leaks or undefined behavior.
User
hmm... right, ok, i don't get it, whats the placement new?
ChatGPT

Placement new is a variant of the new operator in C++ that constructs an object on a pre-allocated buffer. This means you're not allocating new memory; you're just constructing a new object on already allocated memory. The standard new operator combines memory allocation and object construction. However, there are cases where separating these two operations is useful, which is where placement new comes in.

The key reason for using placement new is to have control over how and where an object is stored in memory. It is often used in scenarios where:

    Memory allocation needs to be optimized for performance.
    Objects need to be allocated in a specific memory location, such as in hardware-specific addresses or in a pre-allocated block of memory.
    Custom memory management is required, such as in memory pools, garbage collection systems, or allocator patterns.

The syntax for placement new is as follows:

cpp

#include <new>  // Required for std::nothrow and placement new

//...

void* memory = /* some allocated memory */;
MyClass* object = new (memory) MyClass;  // Constructing object on allocated memory

Here, memory is a pointer to some memory allocated beforehand. The new operator constructs an object of type MyClass in this memory location rather than allocating new memory from the heap.

After using the object, you should call the object's destructor explicitly since using delete on the pointer returned by placement new results in undefined behavior. However, the memory that was originally allocated for placement new (the memory space pointed to by memory) still needs to be deallocated by the appropriate method (like delete, delete[], or free, depending on how the memory was originally allocated).

Here's a simple example:

cpp

#include <new>  // for placement new

struct MyClass {
    // members...
    ~MyClass() {
        // custom destructor tasks...
    }
};

int main() {
    char* buffer = new char[sizeof(MyClass)];  // allocate memory

    MyClass* myObject = new (buffer) MyClass;  // construct object

    // use object...

    myObject->~MyClass();  // explicit destructor call

    delete[] buffer;  // deallocate memory
    return 0;
}

In this example, we allocate memory using a char buffer (just as an example, it could be any type of allocation), use placement new to construct the object, then manually call the destructor and deallocate the memory. The buffer must be allocated with enough memory to hold the object of type MyClass and meet its alignment requirements.
User
#include <new>

int main() {
  struct S {
    int a;
    int b;
  };

  void* memory{::operator new(sizeof(S))};

  S* s = new (memory) S{1, 2};

  void* memory2{::operator new(sizeof(S))};

  // How to use memory2 without placement new?

  ::operator delete(memory);

  return 0;
}
ChatGPT

In your example, you've allocated a raw memory block using ::operator new. This is just memory allocation and doesn't construct an object. For the first block, you've used placement new to construct an object of type S in the allocated memory. For the second block (memory2), if you want to construct an object in that memory without using placement new, you'd typically have to use some form of in-place construction, similar to what placement new does, but manually.

One common approach in C++ is to use the copy or move constructor along with std::addressof to get the address of the constructed object and copy or move it to the allocated memory. However, this still technically involves a form of placement new, as you're constructing an object in-place, but it's done indirectly through the copy or move operation.

Here's an example:

cpp

#include <new> // for std::addressof
#include <algorithm> // for std::copy

int main() {
  struct S {
    int a;
    int b;
  };

  void* memory{::operator new(sizeof(S))};

  S* s = new (memory) S{1, 2};

  void* memory2{::operator new(sizeof(S))};

  // Construct an S object "somewhere else".
  S temporary{3, 4};

  // Now, we want to "copy" this object to memory2.
  // First, we'll need to cast memory2 to S* because we need the correct pointer type.
  S* destination = static_cast<S*>(memory2);

  // Perform the copy.
  // This doesn't use "placement new", but it does use the copy constructor of S.
  *destination = temporary; // Uses the assignment operator of 'S'

  // Alternatively, if S had a non-trivial constructor and you wanted to avoid 'placement new',
  // you'd have to manually call the constructor in a similar manner to 'placement new'.
  // But this is essentially what 'placement new' is designed for.

  // Cleanup
  s->~S(); // Call destructor for the object created with placement new
  destination->~S(); // Call destructor for the object "manually" copied
  ::operator delete(memory);
  ::operator delete(memory2);

  return 0;
}

This example constructs an S object temporary and then manually copies it into the pre-allocated memory memory2. However, it's essential to understand that this operation requires S to have a trivial or manually implemented copy assignment operator that can handle being assigned into uninitialized memory (the default copy assignment operator won't do this correctly). Also, this method is generally not recommended because it's error-prone and goes against typical C++ object construction paradigms.

The correct way to construct objects in pre-allocated memory in C++ is to use placement new because it ensures the proper construction of objects, respecting their constructors and destructors. Other methods either replicate what placement new does under the hood or have limitations and risks, especially with non-trivial types.
User
aha... it is ONLY to allocate memory, but does not construct an object, alright, what if I want to construct an object in that memory?
ChatGPT

If you want to construct an object in memory that's already been allocated, you use what's known as "placement new." This form of new allows you to construct an object (or objects) at a specific memory location. Here's how you could modify your example to do this:

cpp

#include <new> // Required for placement new

int main() {
    struct S {
        int a;
        int b;
    };

    // Allocate raw memory
    void* memory = ::operator new(sizeof(S));

    // Construct an object in the allocated memory
    S* s = new (memory) S{1, 2}; // This is placement new

    // Use the object
    // ... (do something with 's' here)

    // Manually call the destructor for the object
    s->~S();

    // Free the memory
    // Note that we need to use the global operator delete here, not delete,
    // since we used global operator new to allocate the memory
    ::operator delete(memory);

    return 0;
}

In this code:

    We allocate memory for an object of type S using ::operator new, which returns a void* pointer to the allocated memory.
    We use placement new to construct an object of type S at the location pointed to by memory. This is done by using the new operator with the pointer memory as an argument: new (memory) S{1, 2};.
    After we're done with the object, we manually call its destructor. This is necessary because using placement new means the delete operator won't get called automatically, so the destructor won't get called unless we do it ourselves.
    Finally, we free the memory using ::operator delete. Like with the destructor, we need to do this manually because the memory was allocated with ::operator new, so the delete operator won't be called automatically.

This method of constructing objects allows for more control over how and when memory for objects is allocated and deallocated, but it also requires you to manage memory yourself and ensure that destructors are called and memory is freed appropriately.
User
can i move it into the destination, the temporary?
ChatGPT

In C++, "moving" an object typically refers to transferring ownership of a resource from one object to another, a concept particularly relevant for objects that manage dynamic memory or other resources. This is achieved through move constructors and move assignment operators, which are part of the C++11 standard.

However, when dealing with raw memory and placement new, the concept of moving isn't directly applicable in the same way. Once you've constructed an object in a specific memory location using placement new, that object exists at that location, and the concept of "moving" it doesn't work in the traditional sense.

If you're asking about creating a temporary object and then moving its resources into a new object located in your allocated memory, that's possible if the object's class supports move semantics.

Here's how you might do it:

cpp

#include <new>
#include <utility> // for std::move

struct Resource {
    // Imagine this is a resource like a large array or something that manages memory
    // Move constructor
    Resource(Resource&& other) {
        // logic to move the resource from 'other' to this object
    }

    // Other members...
};

struct S {
    Resource res;

    // Move constructor
    S(S&& other) : res(std::move(other.res)) {
        // other members are moved appropriately
    }

    // Other members...
};

int main() {
    // Create a temporary object
    S temp{ /* initialization args */ };

    // Allocate raw memory for type S
    void* memory = ::operator new(sizeof(S));

    // Construct a new object in the allocated memory by invoking the move constructor
    S* s = new (memory) S(std::move(temp));

    // Use 's' as needed...

    // When done, manually call the destructor
    s->~S();

    // And free the memory
    ::operator delete(memory);

    return 0;
}

In this code, S is an object that manages a resource. We first create a temporary object temp and then move it into a newly constructed object s in the memory we allocated. The std::move function is used to cast temp to an rvalue, indicating it's eligible for moving. The move constructor of S handles the process of moving the resources. After the object s is no longer needed, we manually destroy it and deallocate the memory.

Remember, "moving" in this context means the resources of the temporary object are transferred to the new object, and the temporary object is left in a valid but unspecified state.

  ::operator delete(memory);

why does this example delete the memory and the object created?
ChatGPT

In your code, you're correctly allocating memory for objects of type S and using placement new to construct an object in the allocated memory. However, in the case of memory2, you're not using placement new; instead, you're copying the values from another instance tmp to the memory pointed by destination.

Here's what happens step by step:

    You allocate raw, uninitialized memory blocks memory and memory2 of size sufficient for an object of type S.

    You use placement new to construct an object s of type S in the memory location memory. This calls the constructor of S and initializes the object's members.

    You create a temporary object tmp of type S and initialize its members.

    You cast the raw memory pointer memory2 to a pointer to S, named destination. However, no constructor is called for destination; it points to uninitialized memory.

    You assign tmp to *destination. Since destination points to uninitialized memory and you haven't used placement new, this doesn't construct a new S object in memory2; instead, it uses the default assignment operator to copy the values of tmp's members to the memory location of destination. This is valid because S is a simple struct with no user-defined constructor, and its assignment just involves copying the int members.

    You manually call the destructor on both s and destination. This is necessary because placement new was used to construct s, and for destination, it's technically not required because it was never properly constructed, to begin with, but it's not harmful in this case since the destructor does nothing special. However, if S had a non-trivial destructor, this could lead to undefined behavior.

    You free the memory using ::operator delete. This is necessary because you allocated it with ::operator new, and it won't be deallocated automatically.

The key point here is that while s is properly constructed with placement new, destination is not. It's merely a block of memory whose contents get overwritten by the assignment operator. If S had complex data members (like pointers or types with non-trivial constructors and destructors), this approach could lead to issues. Always use placement new when you intend to construct an object in allocated memory.

To observe the behavior of memory allocation, object construction, and memory deallocation, we can add some print statements to the program. However, it's important to note that C++ does not provide a standard way to observe the actual memory deallocation or object destruction directly. We can, however, infer what's happening through the constructors, destructors, and by monitoring the program's output and behavior.

For this purpose, let's modify the struct S to have a constructor and a destructor and print messages when they are invoked. This way, we can observe when an object is constructed and destroyed. However, there is no standard way to directly observe the freeing of raw memory (other than possibly using custom memory allocators or tools); we just have to trust that ::operator delete does its job.

Here's how you might modify your code:

cpp

#include <iostream>
#include <new>

struct S {
    int a;
    int b;

    S(int a, int b) : a(a), b(b) {
        std::cout << "S constructor called. a: " << a << ", b: " << b << "\n";
    }

    ~S() {
        std::cout << "S destructor called. a: " << a << ", b: " << b << "\n";
    }
};

int main() {
    void* memory{::operator new(sizeof(S))};

    S* s = new (memory) S{1, 2};
    std::cout << "s address: " << s << ", values: " << s->a << ", " << s->b << "\n";

    void* memory2{::operator new(sizeof(S))};
    S* destination{static_cast<S*>(memory2)};
    // Using placement new here to properly construct `destination` in memory.
    new (destination) S{3, 4};

    std::cout << "destination address: " << destination << ", values: " << destination->a << ", " << destination->b << "\n";

    s->~S();
    destination->~S(); // This will now properly call the destructor since we used placement new.

    // There's no standard way to print or verify the memory deallocation in C++. We have to trust that these calls work.
    ::operator delete(memory);
    ::operator delete(memory2);

    return 0;
}

This program now uses constructors and destructors to print messages when objects are created and destroyed. It also uses placement new for both s and destination to ensure that the objects are properly constructed. The memory addresses of the objects are printed to show that they occupy the memory we allocated. The destruction of these objects (invoking their destructors) is also evident from the messages.

As for memory deallocation, the C++ language doesn't provide a built-in way to "observe" memory being freed; it happens implicitly when you call ::operator delete. Professional developers often use tools like valgrind, AddressSanitizer, or platform-specific tools to detect memory leaks or monitor memory usage for more complex applications.

static data member is not allowed why
ChatGPT

In C++, a static data member inside a class is declared in the class definition but must be defined separately, usually in a source (.cpp) file. This is because the static data member is shared among all instances of the class, and there needs to be a single definition of the member that all objects refer to, as per the One Definition Rule (ODR) in C++.

The error you're seeing is likely because you've only declared the static member variable and not defined it. Here's how you can correct this:

    Declare the static member in the class definition (usually in a header file, if you're using one).
    Define the static member in a source file.

Here's an example of how you might do this:

cpp

// In the header file (e.g., S.h) or at the top of your source file before the class definition

#include <iostream>

struct S {
    static int id_counter; // declaration
    int id;
    int a;
    int b;

    S(int a, int b) : id(++id_counter), a(a), b(b) {
        std::cout << "S(" << a << ", " << b << ") with ID: " << id << "\n";
    }

    ~S() { std::cout << "~S(" << a << ", " << b << ") with ID: " << id << "\n"; }
};

// In the source file (e.g., S.cpp) or in your main source file after the class definition but outside any function

int S::id_counter = 0; // definition

// ... rest of your code

This way, id_counter will be initialized once when the program starts, and each S object will increment it upon construction, giving each object a unique ID. Remember, the static member definition (the line int S::id_counter = 0;) should appear in exactly one source file only to avoid linker errors related to multiple definitions.
User
so i cant use static memeber if I declare class inside function?
ChatGPT

You can still use a static member variable when a class is defined within a function (also known as a local class), but the usage is more limited compared to regular classes. In standard C++ (prior to C++17), a local class cannot have static data members (or static functions). However, starting from C++17, you can define a static member inside a local class, but it has to be declared and initialized at the same point, and it can't be ODR-used (no out-of-line definitions are allowed, and it can't be taken by address or reference except for inline functions).

Here is how you can use a static variable inside a function from C++17 onwards:

cpp

#include <iostream>

int main() {
    struct S {
        int a, b;
        inline static int id_counter = 0; // Inline static member declaration with initialization

        S(int a, int b) : a{a}, b{b} {
            ++id_counter; // This usage is fine because it's not ODR-used
            std::cout << "S(" << a << ", " << b << ") - Object number: " << id_counter << "\n";
        }
    };

    S s1(1, 2);
    S s2(3, 4);

    // std::cout << &S::id_counter; // This would be an error because it's ODR-used

    return 0;
}

This program will work as expected, and id_counter will count the number of S objects created. However, remember that this feature is available from C++17 onwards, so you need to make sure your compiler is set to use C++17 or later. You can usually do this by using the -std=c++17 flag (or higher, like -std=c++20) in your compiler settings.

why does this code destroy

only once? but the other one twice
ChatGPT

The behavior you're observing is due to how objects are constructed and destructed in your code. Let's break it down step by step:

    You allocate memory for two S objects using ::operator new but do not yet construct the objects.
    You use placement new to construct an S object in the first block of memory. This calls the constructor, and you see the output from the constructor.
    You create a temporary S object called tmp. This also calls the constructor, and you see the output from the constructor.
    You then copy the values from tmp to the memory pointed to by destination using the assignment operator. However, this does not call the constructor for an S object at the destination memory location; it only copies the values of tmp's members to the memory location pointed to by destination. Hence, no constructor output is seen for this operation.
    You explicitly call the destructor for s and destination. The destructor for s works as expected because s points to a fully formed S object. However, destination points to memory that was never properly constructed as an S object using placement new; it just holds the copied data of tmp. So, when the destructor is called on destination, it is technically invoking undefined behavior because the object was never fully constructed at that location. In practice, it might just run the destructor code on the memory content without knowing that it's not a valid object.
    You delete the memory for s and destination using ::operator delete.

The reason you see the constructor and destructor for the tmp object is that it's a fully formed object that's created and destroyed in the scope of the main function. However, the destructor is not called twice for the object with values {1, 2}; it's called once for s and once for tmp (which has values {3, 4}). The confusion might arise from the fact that you copied tmp's data to destination, but that doesn't form a new object - it's just a copy of the data.

To have the constructor called for the destination object, you would need to use placement new just like you did for s. As for the destructor, it's crucial to understand that you should only call it for objects that were fully constructed. Calling destructors for memory that wasn't constructed as an object (like what's happening with destination) is undefined behavior.

do we have guarantees that allocated memory will store the object correctly?
ChatGPT

The code you've written is a bit tricky because it involves low-level memory management that's usually handled by higher-level constructs in C++. There are a few things to unpack here, particularly regarding object lifetime, memory allocation, and data alignment.

    Guarantees on Object Storage:
    When you allocate memory using ::operator new, it allocates raw, uninitialized memory. This memory is suitable for holding an object of the appropriate size, but no object exists in this memory until a constructor is called to initialize (construct) an object there (this is what placement new does). The memory is just a block of bytes until it's initialized, and there's no type associated with it.

    When you use placement new, as in new (memory) S{1, 2}, you're constructing an object of type S in the allocated memory. This is when the memory begins to "store an object correctly" because the constructor initializes the object's state.

    Data Alignment:
    Object storage must also respect the alignment requirements of the types they store. Improper alignment can lead to performance penalties or errors (though most platforms will give you correctly aligned memory for common types when using ::operator new). C++17 introduced std::align in the <memory> header, which can be used to adjust pointers to meet alignment requirements. However, ::operator new typically returns memory suitably aligned for standard types.

    Lifetime and Destruction:
    When you're done with the object, you need to call its destructor explicitly (since you used placement new, the delete keyword won't work as it won't know how to call the destructor for an object in raw memory). This is what you're doing with s->~S(); and destination->~S();. After the destructor is called, the memory is still allocated, but the object's lifetime has ended. You then need to free the memory using ::operator delete.

    The reason you don't use delete here is that delete does two things: it calls the destructor, and it frees the memory. With placement new, the memory wasn't allocated by new, so delete doesn't know how to free it. You have to do these two steps manually.

    Copying Objects:
    When you do *destination = tmp;, you're using the copy assignment operator. This doesn't construct a new S in destination; it just copies the state of tmp into the S that's presumed to exist at destination. However, you haven't actually constructed an S at destination (with a constructor call), you've only allocated suitable memory. So, this state is a bit murky: you're treating memory as an S object when no S constructor has been called on it. This is undefined behavior.

To make this code correct, you should use placement new to construct an S instance in the memory pointed to by destination, just like you did for s. That would look something like this:

cpp

new (destination) S{3, 4};  // Now destination really is an S, constructed with S's constructor

This pattern you're using is very close to what happens under the hood when you use new and delete, but it's manual and doesn't have the safety checks that new and delete do. It's prone to errors, especially with complex types or in exception-heavy code. In modern C++, it's generally best to use smart pointers or other RAII techniques to manage memory, which handle these details more safely.
User
in which order does the delete clean up the memory?
ChatGPT

In C++, the delete operator is used to destroy an object and release the memory that was allocated to it. Understanding the order of operations for delete can help clarify how memory cleanup works. Here's the sequence of events when delete is called on a pointer to an object:

    Destructor Call: If the pointer is not null, and the type has a destructor, the destructor for the object is called first. The destructor is responsible for cleanup tasks related to the object's state, such as releasing memory that the object may have allocated for its internal use, or closing file handles or network connections. The object itself still occupies memory at this point, but its state may have been partially or fully dismantled by the destructor.

    Memory Deallocation: After the destructor finishes executing, the memory previously occupied by the object is deallocated, returning it to the system (or the runtime's free memory pool). The actual process of memory deallocation depends on the runtime environment and the operating system; the details are abstracted away from the C++ program.

    Pointer Dangling: After delete, the pointer that pointed to the object still exists, but it now becomes a "dangling pointer." This means that the pointer still holds the memory address where the object used to be, but that memory is no longer allocated to the object (and can be reused for something else). Dereferencing the pointer after this point is undefined behavior and can lead to program crashes or incorrect behavior.

Here's a brief example to illustrate this process:

cpp

MyClass* obj = new MyClass(); // Allocates memory and constructs an object of MyClass.
delete obj;                   // 1. Calls MyClass's destructor, if it has one.
                              // 2. Deallocates memory.
                              // 3. 'obj' is now a dangling pointer.

When dealing with arrays, you must use delete[] instead of delete, as it knows how to call the destructors for all the elements in the array and how much memory to deallocate:

cpp

MyClass* array = new MyClass[10]; // Allocates memory for 10 objects and calls constructor for each.
delete[] array;                   // 1. Calls destructor for each of the 10 objects, in the reverse order of their construction.
                                  // 2. Deallocates the memory block.
                                  // 3. 'array' is now a dangling pointer.

If MyClass has a custom destructor, it's called for each object in the array (in reverse order of construction) before the memory for the array is deallocated.

Remember, it's important to ensure that you don't use delete on the same pointer twice (double delete), and you don't use the object after it has been deleted (dangling pointer dereference), as both scenarios lead to undefined behavior. Also, in modern C++, using smart pointers (std::unique_ptr, std::shared_ptr) is preferred over raw pointers, as they handle this process automatically and are less prone to errors.
User
well i wanna try something else other than placement new, I wanna implement this without placement new
ChatGPT

If you want to manage memory allocation and object construction without using placement new, you have to dive deeper into how objects are constructed and destructed in C++. Here's how you might do it, though it's important to note that this method is unconventional and more error-prone than using standard language features.

In the following example, we'll allocate memory using malloc (since we're not calling new, no constructor gets called). Then, we'll use a copy constructor to "construct" an instance in the allocated memory. Finally, we'll manually call the destructor and use free to deallocate the memory.

Here's how you could do it:

cpp

#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib> // for malloc/free

struct S {
    int a;
    int b;

    S(int a, int b) : a(a), b(b) {
        std::cout << "Constructed " << a << ", " << b << std::endl;
    }

    S(const S& other) : a(other.a), b(other.b) { // copy constructor
        std::cout << "Copied " << a << ", " << b << std::endl;
    }

    ~S() {
        std::cout << "Destructed " << a << ", " << b << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Allocate raw memory (not an object yet)
    void* rawMemory = std::malloc(sizeof(S));
    if (!rawMemory) {
        std::cerr << "Memory allocation failed" << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    // Construct an object 'temp' to be copied
    S temp(1, 2);

    // Use the copy constructor to construct an object in the allocated memory
    S* object = new (rawMemory) S(temp);

    // Use the object
    std::cout << "Object: " << object->a << ", " << object->b << std::endl;

    // Manually call the destructor
    object->~S();

    // Free the memory
    std::free(rawMemory);

    return 0;
}

In this code:

    We allocate raw memory with malloc.
    We construct a temporary object temp.
    We use the copy constructor to construct an object of type S in the previously allocated memory.
    We manually call the destructor for the object.
    We deallocate the memory with free.

This method essentially does what placement new does, but manually and with more room for error. It's crucial to ensure the allocated memory is properly aligned for the type of object you're constructing. Misalignment can lead to undefined behavior.

Moreover, this approach is not typical in modern C++ programming and should be used with caution. In general, it's safer and more readable to use constructors, destructors, and smart pointers to manage the lifetimes of objects. This method circumvents some of the safety mechanisms of C++, so it should be used judiciously and primarily in scenarios where you have specific reasons to manage memory in this manner.
User
is this concept the only way that works if I don't want to use the placement new?
ChatGPT

The concept demonstrated in the previous example essentially mimics what placement new does: it constructs an object on already-allocated memory. However, if you're looking for alternatives to placement new, there are limited options because placement new is the standard way in C++ to construct an object in pre-allocated memory.

That said, beyond using the copy constructor as in the previous example, you could also consider the following method, which uses a custom memory allocator. This is more advanced and is typically used in scenarios where you need fine-grained control over memory allocation, such as for performance reasons, developing a memory pool, or implementing certain data structures.

Here's a simplified example of how you might use a custom allocator:

cpp

#include <iostream>
#include <memory>

struct S {
    int a;
    int b;

    S(int a, int b) : a(a), b(b) {
        std::cout << "Constructed " << a << ", " << b << std::endl;
    }

    ~S() {
        std::cout << "Destructed " << a << ", " << b << std::endl;
    }
};

template <class T>
struct CustomAllocator {
    typedef T value_type;

    CustomAllocator() = default;

    template <class U>
    CustomAllocator (const CustomAllocator<U>&) {}

    T* allocate(std::size_t n) {
        return static_cast<T*>(::operator new(n * sizeof(T)));
    }

    void deallocate(T* p, std::size_t) noexcept {
        ::operator delete(p);
    }
};

int main() {
    CustomAllocator<S> allocator;

    // Allocate memory for one object
    S* memory = allocator.allocate(1);

    // Construct an object in the allocated memory
    new (memory) S(1, 2);

    // Use the object
    std::cout << "Object: " << memory->a << ", " << memory->b << std::endl;

    // Call the destructor explicitly
    memory->~S();

    // Deallocate memory
    allocator.deallocate(memory, 1);

    return 0;
}

In this example, CustomAllocator is a simplified custom allocator that uses global new and delete for memory management. The main function demonstrates how you can use this allocator to reserve memory, construct an object in that memory, and then eventually destroy the object and free the memory.

While this method also involves a form of placement new, it abstracts the memory management into the allocator, which could be customized further as per your requirements. This pattern is more common in scenarios like custom data structures, where you might want to override standard memory management for efficiency reasons.

However, in standard application code, it's usually best to rely on standard constructs like smart pointers, standard containers, and their default allocators, unless you have a specific need for custom memory management, as these standard constructs are designed to manage the complexity and help prevent issues like memory leaks and undefined behavior.
User
hm how is new (memory) s(1, 2) implemented?

how can i implement something that works like that? why does new take in as argument memory and how does it call S(1, 2) after like that?
ChatGPT

The syntax new (memory) S(1, 2) is known as placement new in C++. It's a variant of the new operator that constructs an object on a pre-allocated buffer instead of allocating memory and then constructing the object there. Here's how it works:

    The keyword new is followed by a set of parentheses containing a pointer, which is the pre-allocated memory's address (in this case, memory).
    After the parentheses, you specify the type of object you want to construct and its constructor arguments (in this case, S(1, 2)).

The C++ standard library provides an implementation of placement new. Here's how it looks, simplified:

cpp

#include <new>

void* operator new(std::size_t, void* ptr) noexcept {
    return ptr;
}

This overload of the new operator takes two parameters: the size of the object and the pointer to the memory location. It simply returns the passed-in pointer, doing nothing with the size. The reason it takes a size parameter (even though it doesn't use it) is to match the signature that's expected by the new operator.

So, when you write new (memory) S(1, 2), here's what happens, step-by-step:

    The new operator function is called with memory as its argument.
    The new operator function returns the memory pointer.
    The S constructor is called with 1, 2 as its arguments, and it constructs an S object at the address held by memory.

The actual process involves a bit more under the hood in terms of compiler operations and memory handling, but this is a simplified view of the operations involved.

You generally shouldn't need to implement placement new yourself, as it's provided by the C++ standard library. However, if you're trying to understand how it works for educational purposes or to implement something similar but functionally different, you could mimic its behavior by writing a function that takes a pointer to a memory location and then uses in-place construction. This would essentially be re-implementing placement new in a different form. Here's a very simplified example of how you might do this:

cpp

template <typename T, typename... Args>
T* construct_in_place(void* memory, Args&&... args) {
    return new (memory) T(std::forward<Args>(args)...);
}

In this example, construct_in_place is a function template that takes a pointer to a memory location and some constructor arguments, then uses placement new to construct an object of type T in that location. It's essentially a wrapper around placement new.

Remember, handling memory in C++ can be risky business due to potential issues like leaks, dangling pointers, and undefined behavior. Be sure you understand the implications and risks of low-level memory management before you use these techniques in real-world projects.
