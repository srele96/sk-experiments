# Use Lambdas Creatively

The goal of this experiment is to explore the use of lambdas in C++ as creatively as possible.

Use lambdas in whichever way I can think of.

At some point I got bored, but I'm sure I can come up with quite a few more! Such fun!

## Description

I wanted to think of as many ways as possible to use lambdas in C++. I started with the function pointers, ended up overloading struct `operator()` to invoke it as lambda. I enjoy the complexity of C++ and the amount of flexibility it gives. I love in how many ways I can do one thing. Whenever I let myself get creative and play with a feature of C++ language, it always amazes me.

## How to run

The `run.bat` takes filename argument, compiles and runs it. Works on windows. Requires locally installed clang++ compiler.

```cmd
run main.cpp
```
