# Observer Design Pattern

Implementation of the observer design pattern to prove to myself that design patterns are abstract and not bound to a language. Library developers may implement a library that implements a design pattern, but the design pattern itself is not bound to a language.

Same goes for ISO standards. A JavaScript, C++, OpenGL, Vulkan, are specifications.

## Compile and run

```powershell
clang++ -std=c++17 Observer.cpp -o Observer.exe; ./Observer.exe
```
