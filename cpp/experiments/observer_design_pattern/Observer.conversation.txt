Sure, here's a LeetCode-style problem that would be well-suited for implementing the Observer design pattern in C++ through inheritance and interfaces, with multiple observers.
Problem: Stock Price Alert System

Description:

You are tasked with designing a stock price alert system using the Observer design pattern in C++. The system will have the following components:

    Stock: This class represents a stock in the market. It should have attributes like stock name and price.
    StockMarket: This class manages a collection of Stock objects. It should allow adding and updating stock prices.
    Observer Interface: This interface should define the method that all observers must implement to receive updates.
    DisplayBoard and AlertSystem: Two concrete classes that implement the Observer interface. DisplayBoard displays the latest stock prices, and AlertSystem sends alerts when a stock price reaches a certain threshold.

Requirements:

    Implement an Observer interface with an update() method.
    Stock should be a class with properties for the name and price of the stock. It should notify all observers whenever its price changes.
    StockMarket should be able to add new stocks and update the prices of existing stocks.
    DisplayBoard and AlertSystem should both implement the Observer interface. DisplayBoard should display the latest prices of stocks, and AlertSystem should check for price thresholds and send alerts.
    The system should support multiple DisplayBoard and AlertSystem instances observing the same stocks.
    When the price of a stock changes, all registered observers should be notified.

Example:

Suppose the StockMarket has two stocks: Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOGL). Two DisplayBoard instances and one AlertSystem are observing these stocks. When the price of Apple stock changes, both DisplayBoard instances should update the display, and the AlertSystem should check if the new price crosses a predefined threshold and, if so, trigger an alert.

This problem requires you to apply the Observer design pattern in a real-world scenario. It tests your understanding of object-oriented principles, particularly inheritance, interfaces, and design patterns in C++. The problem is open-ended in terms of the exact implementation details, which allows you to be creative with your solution.

c++ std::, give me something that generates unique id
ChatGPT
ChatGPT

In C++, you can use the std::uuid library, which is part of the Boost library, to generate unique IDs. However, as of my last update in April 2023, the C++ Standard Library (std::) itself does not include a direct feature for generating UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers).

If you are looking for a standard library solution without external dependencies, you can create a simple unique ID generator using features like std::chrono for time-based IDs or hashing mechanisms combined with std::random_device for random unique IDs.

For a more robust solution, the Boost library's boost::uuids::uuid is commonly used.

Would you like an example using the standard library features, or would you prefer to use the Boost library for this?

how to define static member of struct?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT

To define a static member of a struct in C++, you need to follow these steps:

    Declare the Static Member in the Struct: First, declare the static member within the struct definition. Static members are not tied to any particular instance of the struct, but rather belong to the struct as a whole.

    Define the Static Member Outside the Struct: After declaring the static member, you need to define it outside the struct. This is typically done in a source file (.cpp file). It's important to note that you should not redeclare the static keyword in this definition.

Here's a simple example to illustrate this:
Declaration in a Header File (e.g., MyStruct.h)

cpp

struct MyStruct {
    static int staticMember; // Declaration of the static member
};

Definition in a Source File (e.g., MyStruct.cpp)

cpp

#include "MyStruct.h"

int MyStruct::staticMember = 0; // Definition of the static member

In this example, MyStruct has a static member staticMember of type int. The member is declared inside the struct and defined outside, in a source file. The value 0 is assigned to it in the definition.

Remember, the static member is shared among all instances of the struct. Any changes made to this member will be reflected in all instances of MyStruct.
User
You
can static class member be private?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT

Yes, a static class member can be private in C++. When a static member is declared as private, it means that it can only be accessed from within the class itself (or by friends of the class, if any). This is often used to encapsulate class-level data that should not be directly accessible from outside the class.

Here's a brief example to illustrate this:

cpp

class MyClass {
private:
    static int privateStaticMember; // Private static member

public:
    static int getPrivateStaticMember() {
        return privateStaticMember; // Accessing private static member within class
    }

    static void setPrivateStaticMember(int value) {
        privateStaticMember = value; // Modifying private static member within class
    }
};

// Definition of the static member outside the class
int MyClass::privateStaticMember = 0;

// Usage
int main() {
    int value = MyClass::getPrivateStaticMember(); // Accessing via public static method
    MyClass::setPrivateStaticMember(10); // Modifying via public static method
}

In this example, privateStaticMember is a private static member of MyClass. It cannot be accessed directly outside the class. However, public static member functions getPrivateStaticMember and setPrivateStaticMember are provided to access and modify this private static member, demonstrating how encapsulation can be maintained while still allowing controlled access to the private static data.

AddObserver

method that uses std::weak_ptr to shared pointer, how do i define that method?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT

To define an AddObserver method that uses std::weak_ptr to a shared pointer, you'll typically be working within a context where you have observers subscribing to updates from a subject (or observable). In this scenario, std::weak_ptr is used to avoid creating strong reference cycles between the subject and its observers.

Here's an example of how you might define such a method:
Step 1: Define Your Observer Interface

First, define an Observer interface that all observers must implement:

cpp

class IObserver {
public:
    virtual void update() = 0;
    virtual ~IObserver() {}
};

Step 2: Define Your Subject Class

The subject (or observable) class maintains a list of observers. We'll use std::weak_ptr to refer to these observers.

cpp

#include <vector>
#include <memory>
#include <algorithm>

class Subject {
private:
    std::vector<std::weak_ptr<IObserver>> observers;

public:
    void addObserver(const std::shared_ptr<IObserver>& observer) {
        observers.push_back(observer);
    }

    void notifyObservers() {
        // Iterate through the weak_ptrs, checking if they are still valid
        for (auto it = observers.begin(); it != observers.end(); ) {
            if (auto observer = it->lock()) {
                observer->update();
                ++it;
            } else {
                // Remove expired weak_ptrs
                it = observers.erase(it);
            }
        }
    }
};

Explanation:

    AddObserver Method: The addObserver method takes a std::shared_ptr to an IObserver object. It then adds a std::weak_ptr to this observer to the observers vector. This weak_ptr allows the Subject to refer to the observer without owning it, which means it won't prevent the observer's destruction when there are no more strong references to it.

    notifyObservers Method: This method iterates through the list of weak_ptr observers, converting each to a shared_ptr (using lock()) before calling the update method. If the lock method returns a null shared_ptr, it means the observer has been destroyed, and hence it removes the corresponding weak_ptr from the list.

By using std::weak_ptr in this way, you avoid potential memory leaks and circular references that can occur if Subject and IObserver instances hold strong references to each other.

observer.lock()

should i do

std::weak_ptr<>
or
std::shared_ptr<>

for return type of this? to preserve weak reference
ChatGPT
ChatGPT

When you use observer.lock() on a std::weak_ptr, it returns a std::shared_ptr. This is by design, as the purpose of lock() is to create a temporary std::shared_ptr that ensures the resource managed by the std::weak_ptr remains alive while you are accessing it.

Here's how it works:

    If the original std::shared_ptr that the std::weak_ptr is observing still exists (i.e., the object hasn't been destroyed), lock() will successfully create and return a new std::shared_ptr pointing to the same object. This temporary std::shared_ptr ensures the object stays alive for as long as you're using it.

    If the original std::shared_ptr no longer exists (i.e., the object has already been destroyed), lock() will return an empty std::shared_ptr, which you can check for validity.

This mechanism allows you to safely access the resource in a thread-safe way, without permanently extending its lifetime beyond what is managed by the original std::shared_ptr.

In your implementation, when you call observer.lock(), you should assign the result to a std::shared_ptr variable. This is how you can check if the std::weak_ptr still points to a live object and safely access that object if it does. Here's a small snippet to illustrate:

cpp

std::weak_ptr<IObserver> observerWeakPtr; // Assume this is already assigned

std::shared_ptr<IObserver> observerSharedPtr = observerWeakPtr.lock();
if (observerSharedPtr) {
    // Observer is still alive, and now you have a shared_ptr to access it safely
    observerSharedPtr->update();
} else {
    // The observer has been destroyed, and the weak_ptr is now empty
}

In summary, when using lock() on a std::weak_ptr, the return type should be a std::shared_ptr to ensure safe access to the resource.

display_.get() << '(' << stock.ID() << ") " << stock.Name() << ": "

ChatGPT
ChatGPT

The line of code you've provided seems to be attempting to use the << operator to stream data to a pointer obtained by calling get() on display_, which appears to be a smart pointer (like std::unique_ptr or std::shared_ptr). However, this code will not work as expected because the get() method of a smart pointer returns a raw pointer to the managed object, not a stream.

If display_ is a smart pointer to an object like std::ostream or a similar stream object, you need to dereference the pointer to use the stream insertion operator (<<). Here's how you can correct the code:

cpp

*display_ << '(' << stock.ID() << ") " << stock.Name() << ": "
          << stock.Price() << "\n";

In this corrected code, *display_ dereferences the smart pointer to get the stream object, and then you can use the << operator as usual to insert data into the stream.

If display_ is not a smart pointer to a stream object, then the approach will need to be different. You would need to ensure that the object pointed to by display_ supports the << operator for the types being inserted. If it doesn't, you'll need to either implement that functionality or use a different method to output your data.

its reference wrapper<std::ostream>
ChatGPT
ChatGPT

If display_ is a std::reference_wrapper<std::ostream>, the way you're trying to use it with the << operator is slightly incorrect. You don't need to use get() in this case. A std::reference_wrapper allows you to use the wrapped object as if it were the object itself, so you can just use display_ directly with the << operator.

Here's the correct way to use it:

cpp

display_ << '(' << stock.ID() << ") " << stock.Name() << ": "
         << stock.Price() << "\n";

In this example, display_ is treated much like a normal reference to std::ostream. The std::reference_wrapper essentially overloads the operator-> and operator* to return a reference to the wrapped object, allowing you to use it in a very natural way, as if you were dealing directly with the std::ostream object.

ChatGPT

The error you're encountering indicates that the std::reference_wrapper<std::ostream> is not directly compatible with the << operator. The std::reference_wrapper provides get() to access the reference it wraps, but it does not directly overload the stream insertion operator (<<).

In order to use the << operator with a std::reference_wrapper wrapping an std::ostream, you need to first obtain the reference from the wrapper using get(), and then you can use the << operator on that reference. Here's the correct way to do it:

cpp

display_.get() << '(' << stock.ID() << ") " << stock.Name() << ": "
               << stock.Price() << "\n";

In this corrected code, display_.get() returns a reference to the std::ostream object, and then you can use the << operator as usual to insert data into the stream. This should resolve the error you're seeing.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT

The error message you're encountering suggests that the std::reference_wrapper<std::ostream> is not behaving as expected with the stream insertion operator (<<). This is unusual because a std::reference_wrapper should be able to implicitly convert to a reference of its wrapped type, allowing for normal usage with the << operator.

However, if this implicit conversion is not happening as expected, you can explicitly get the reference from the std::reference_wrapper using the get() method and then use the << operator. Here's how you can modify your code:

cpp

std::ostream& stream = display_.get();
stream << "( " << stock.ID() << ") " << stock.Name() << ": " << stock.Price() << "\n";

In this revised code:

    display_.get() is used to get the std::ostream reference from the std::reference_wrapper.
    We then use this reference with the << operator to perform the desired output operation.

This should work without the error you are encountering. If you are still encountering issues, there might be something else at play in your codebase that is not immediately apparent from the provided snippet. In such cases, it's often helpful to review the entire context of how display_ is being initialized and used.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT

The error you're encountering seems to suggest that the std::reference_wrapper<std::ostream> is not correctly being used with the stream insertion operator (<<). While std::reference_wrapper is designed to be implicitly convertible to a reference of its contained type, it appears that the conversion is not happening in your case when you try to use it directly with the stream insertion operator.

To address this issue, you can explicitly get the reference from the std::reference_wrapper using the get() method and then use the << operator on the obtained reference. It's important to ensure that the get() method is called correctly. Here's how you can adjust your code:

cpp

auto& stream = display_.get();  // Get the reference to the std::ostream
stream << "( " << stock.ID() << ") " << stock.Name() << ": " << stock.Price() << "\n";

In this adjusted code:

    auto& stream = display_.get(); is used to get the std::ostream reference from the std::reference_wrapper.
    We then use stream, which is a reference to std::ostream, with the << operator to perform the output operation.

This approach explicitly separates the steps of obtaining the std::ostream reference and using it, which should circumvent the issue you are encountering.

If you're still facing issues, it might be necessary to recheck the overall structure and initialization of display_ and ensure that it is correctly set up as a std::reference_wrapper to an std::ostream object.

is this correct?

ChatGPT
ChatGPT

Yes, the code you've provided is correct in terms of using std::reference_wrapper<std::ostream> within a class that inherits from an IObserver interface. Here's a breakdown of what you've done:

    Class Definition: DisplayBoard is defined as a class inheriting from IObserver.

    Private Member: display_ is a std::reference_wrapper<std::ostream>. This is a good use of std::reference_wrapper to store a reference to an output stream.

    Constructor: The constructor of DisplayBoard takes a reference to std::ostream and initializes display_ with it. This is the standard way to initialize a std::reference_wrapper.

    OnUpdate Method: In the OnUpdate method (which overrides a virtual method from IObserver), you are correctly using display_.get() to obtain a reference to the std::ostream and then using the stream insertion operator (<<) to write "hello" to the stream.

This setup should work correctly provided that:

    Stock is a properly defined class or struct with the necessary properties.
    IObserver has a virtual method OnUpdate that takes a const Stock& as a parameter.

When OnUpdate is called on a DisplayBoard object, it will output "hello" to the stream that was passed to its constructor. Just ensure that the stream is valid (e.g., std::cout or a valid std::ofstream) at the time of DisplayBoard's construction and remains valid for the lifetime of the DisplayBoard object.

error:

ChatGPT
ChatGPT

The error you're encountering in your C++ code is due to an incorrect usage of the stream insertion operator (<<). In the OnUpdate method, you are trying to insert a string literal "hello" into display_.get(), which is a reference to an std::ostream.

The issue likely arises because std::ostream does not have an overload of the << operator that directly accepts a const char[] (string literal) when it is a reference. To resolve this issue, you should ensure that display_.get() returns an std::ostream object that can be used with the << operator.

Here's a revised version of your OnUpdate method:

cpp

void OnUpdate(const Stock &stock) override {
    std::ostream& os = display_.get();
    os << "hello";
}

In this revised version, I first obtain a reference to the std::ostream object using display_.get(), then use this reference with the << operator to insert the string. This approach should solve the error you're encountering.

        observerPtr->OnUpdate(*this);
      }
    }
  }

this one does not print notifying observer, how can i learn why
ChatGPT
ChatGPT

If your NotifyObservers method is not printing "Notifying observer...", it indicates that the block of code inside the if statement is not being executed. This usually happens for one of several reasons related to the use of std::weak_ptr:

    Weak Pointers are Expired: The std::weak_ptr instances in the observers_ collection may have expired. This happens when all std::shared_ptr instances that share ownership with these std::weak_ptr instances are destroyed. If all the shared_ptrs are gone, the weak_ptr cannot lock onto anything, resulting in its lock method returning a null shared_ptr.

    Observers Collection is Empty: The observers_ collection may be empty. This would mean the loop is never entered, and thus, the inside of the if statement is never reached.

    Exception or Early Exit: There might be an exception thrown or an early exit (like a return statement) somewhere in the loop or before the loop starts, which prevents the program from reaching the "Notifying observer..." print statement.

To debug this, you can add more diagnostic print statements or use a debugger. Here's how you might modify the code to add diagnostic prints:

cpp

void NotifyObservers() override {
  std::cout << "Notifying...\n";
  std::cout << "Number of observers: " << observers_.size() << "\n";  // Diagnostic print

  for (std::weak_ptr<IObserver> &observer : observers_) {
    std::shared_ptr<IObserver> observerPtr = observer.lock();
    if (observerPtr) {
      std::cout << "Notifying observer...\n";
      observerPtr->OnUpdate(*this);
    } else {
      std::cout << "Observer pointer expired or null\n";  // Diagnostic print
    }
  }
}

This additional logging should help you understand whether the issue is due to expired weak_ptrs, an empty observers_ collection, or some other reason.

Also, ensure that the observers_ collection is correctly populated with valid std::shared_ptr<IObserver> instances before NotifyObservers is called. This often involves some other parts of your program correctly registering observers with your subject.
User
You
how can i find out if im registering them correctly?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT

To ensure that you're registering observers correctly in a system using the Observer pattern, you need to confirm a few key aspects:

    Observer Registration Method: You should have a method in your subject class (the class which NotifyObservers belongs to) that allows the registration of observers. This method should correctly add observers to the observers_ collection. Usually, observers are added as std::shared_ptr<IObserver> to ensure proper memory management and object lifetimes.

    Observer Object Lifetimes: Ensure that the observer objects (the objects that should receive notifications) are alive and their shared_ptr instances are properly managed when they're registered. If these objects go out of scope and are destroyed, the weak pointers in observers_ will not be able to lock onto them, leading to them being skipped in the notification process.

    Correct Use of Shared and Weak Pointers: Make sure you are using std::shared_ptr and std::weak_ptr appropriately. shared_ptr should be used to manage the lifetime of the observer objects, and weak_ptr should be used in the observers_ collection to avoid circular references.

Here’s a basic example of how you might set up observer registration:

cpp

class Subject {
private:
  std::vector<std::weak_ptr<IObserver>> observers_;

public:
  void RegisterObserver(const std::shared_ptr<IObserver>& observer) {
    observers_.push_back(observer);
  }

  // ... other methods including NotifyObservers ...
};

And the registration might be done like this:

cpp

std::shared_ptr<IObserver> myObserver = std::make_shared<MyObserverImplementation>();
Subject mySubject;
mySubject.RegisterObserver(myObserver);

To verify if the registration is working correctly:

    Check the Size of the Observers Collection: After registering observers, check if the observers_ collection's size increases as expected.

    Debug Print Statements: Add debug print statements in the registration method to confirm that the method is being called and the observer is being added.

    Use a Debugger: Step through your code with a debugger to ensure that observer objects are being created, registered, and stored correctly in the observers_ collection.

    Lifetime Management: Ensure the shared_ptr instances to the observers exist for as long as you need them. If they go out of scope and are destroyed, the corresponding weak_ptr in the observers_ collection will not be able to lock onto a valid observer.

If after checking all these points you find that observers are being registered correctly but are still not being notified, the issue might lie elsewhere in your implementation or in how and when NotifyObservers is being called.

both of these do not trigger it correctly
ChatGPT
ChatGPT

Based on your code snippets, it looks like you're trying to use the Observer pattern in a scenario where Stock objects notify their observers (in this case, instances of DisplayBoard) about changes in their state. There are several aspects to consider here to ensure that the observers are notified correctly.

    Lifetime of Observers: When you create a DisplayBoard instance with std::make_shared<DisplayBoard>(std::cout), it creates a shared pointer to a DisplayBoard. However, if you don't keep a reference to this shared pointer, it will go out of scope and be destroyed immediately after the line is executed. This means that by the time you change the price of the stock, there is no observer left to be notified.

    To fix this, you should maintain a reference to the shared_ptr<DisplayBoard> for the duration you expect it to receive notifications. For example:

    cpp

    auto displayBoardPtr = std::make_shared<DisplayBoard>(std::cout);
    sth->AddObserver(displayBoardPtr);

    This ensures that the DisplayBoard instance remains alive and can be notified.

    Observer Pattern Implementation in Stock Class: Ensure that your Stock class is correctly implemented to support the Observer pattern. This includes maintaining a collection of weak pointers to observers and a mechanism to notify them when relevant events occur (like a price change).

    Notification Trigger: Make sure that the Price method (or any other method that should trigger a notification) in the Stock class actually calls NotifyObservers. The notification isn't automatic; you have to explicitly call this method whenever you want to notify the observers about a change.

Here's a rough outline of how the Stock class might look:

cpp

class Stock {
private:
  std::string name;
  std::string price;
  std::vector<std::weak_ptr<IObserver>> observers_;

public:
  Stock(const std::string& name, const std::string& price) : name{name}, price{price} {}

  void AddObserver(const std::shared_ptr<IObserver>& observer) {
    observers_.push_back(observer);
  }

  void Price(const std::string& newPrice) {
    price = newPrice;
    NotifyObservers();
  }

  void NotifyObservers() {
    for (auto& weakObserver : observers_) {
      if (auto observer = weakObserver.lock()) {
        observer->OnUpdate(*this);
      }
    }
  }
};

Make sure to apply these principles to your implementation and adjust according to the specifics of your classes and architecture.

  sth->AddObserver(std::make_shared<DisplayBoard>(std::cout));
  sth->Price("500");


the code below works

  sth->AddObserver(displayBoard);
  sth->Price("500");

why>?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT

The difference in behavior between your two code snippets is due to the way the lifetime of the DisplayBoard object is managed.

In the first snippet:

cpp

std::shared_ptr<Stock> sth{std::make_shared<Stock>("sth", "300")};
sth->AddObserver(std::make_shared<DisplayBoard>(std::cout));
sth->Price("500");

You are creating an std::shared_ptr<DisplayBoard> inside the AddObserver method call. This shared_ptr is not stored anywhere else, so as soon as the AddObserver method finishes execution, the shared_ptr (and thus the DisplayBoard object it manages) is destroyed because there are no more references to it. Since the DisplayBoard object is destroyed, it is not around when sth->Price("500") is called, so there is no observer to notify.

In the second snippet:

cpp

std::shared_ptr<DisplayBoard> displayBoard{std::make_shared<DisplayBoard>(std::cout)};
sth->AddObserver(displayBoard);
sth->Price("500");

You create an std::shared_ptr<DisplayBoard> and store it in the variable displayBoard. This means that the DisplayBoard object remains alive (because the shared_ptr managing it is still in scope and hasn't been destroyed) when sth->Price("500") is called. Since the DisplayBoard object is still alive, it is available to be notified about the price change.

In summary, the key difference is the lifetime of the DisplayBoard object. In the first snippet, it is destroyed too soon, whereas in the second snippet, it remains alive as long as the displayBoard variable is in scope. This is a crucial aspect of managing object lifetimes with smart pointers like std::shared_ptr.

The error you're encountering is related to the usage of std::unique_ptr within a std::vector. The key part of the error message is:

rust

static_assert failed due to requirement 'is_constructible<std::unique_ptr<Stock, std::default_delete<Stock>>, const std::unique_ptr<Stock, std::default_delete<Stock>> &>::value'

This error is telling you that std::unique_ptr<Stock> cannot be constructed from a const std::unique_ptr<Stock>&, which is what would be required if you try to copy it. The reason for this is that std::unique_ptr is designed to have unique ownership of the object it points to, and therefore it cannot be copied, only moved. When you initialize a std::vector with an initializer list (as you are doing), the elements of the initializer list need to be copyable because the list itself is a temporary object.

To solve this problem, you have a couple of options:

    Use Move Semantics: Instead of trying to copy unique_ptrs, you can explicitly move them into the vector. This transfers ownership of the Stock objects to the unique_ptrs in the vector.

    cpp

std::vector<std::unique_ptr<Stock>> stocks;
stocks.push_back(std::make_unique<Stock>("Apple", 100));
stocks.push_back(std::make_unique<Stock>("Google", 200));

This approach uses push_back to move each unique_ptr into the vector.

Use std::vector::emplace_back: Alternatively, you can use emplace_back which constructs the elements in place.

cpp

    std::vector<std::unique_ptr<Stock>> stocks;
    stocks.emplace_back(std::make_unique<Stock>("Apple", 100));
    stocks.emplace_back(std::make_unique<Stock>("Google", 200));

    This method directly constructs unique_ptr<Stock> objects in the vector's memory space, avoiding the need for a copy or move.

Both of these approaches work because they avoid the need to copy unique_ptr instances, which is not allowed due to their exclusive ownership semantics.

clang tidy says for these interfaces

class IObserver {
public:
  virtual void OnUpdate(const Stock &stock) = 0;
  virtual ~IObserver() = default;
};

class ISubject {
public:
  virtual void AddObserver(const std::shared_ptr<IObserver> &observer) = 0;
  virtual void NotifyObservers() = 0;
  virtual ~ISubject() = default;
};


class 'IObserver' defines a default destructor but does not define a copy constructor, a copy assignment operator, a move constructor or a move assignment operatorclang-tidy(cppcoreguidelines-special-member-functions)

class 'ISubject' defines a default destructor but does not define a copy constructor, a copy assignment operator, a move constructor or a move assignment operatorclang-tidy(cppcoreguidelines-special-member-functions)


however my friend told me that clang tidy does not know they are interface and that errors are fine, what do you think?

Your friend's comment about Clang-Tidy and interfaces is essentially correct. The warning you're seeing from Clang-Tidy is based on a guideline from the C++ Core Guidelines, which generally recommends that if you declare or define one of the special member functions (constructor, destructor, copy/move constructor, copy/move assignment operator), you should consider declaring or defining all of them. This is known as the Rule of Five (or Rule of Three in older C++ standards).

However, this rule does not always apply neatly to abstract classes (interfaces) in C++, especially when you're dealing with polymorphic base classes like IObserver and ISubject in your case. These classes are designed to be interfaces, providing a contract for derived classes rather than holding or managing resources themselves.

Here's why the warning may not be applicable in your situation:

    Polymorphic Base Classes: For classes that are intended to be used polymorphically (like interfaces), you often don't want them to be copyable or movable. This is because copying or moving objects polymorphically can lead to object slicing or other unintended behavior.

    Rule of Zero: Instead of Rule of Five, the Rule of Zero can apply here. If your class is designed in a way that it doesn't manage resources (like memory, file handles, etc.) itself, but relies on smart pointers or other RAII objects to do the resource management, then you don't need to explicitly define these special member functions. The defaults provided by the compiler are often sufficient.

    Interfaces Are Not Meant to Be Copied: Interface classes are generally not meant to be copied or moved. They represent an interface, not a data structure. The purpose of these classes is to be inherited by other classes that implement the interface, not to hold data or resources that would need to be copied or moved.

In conclusion, for your IObserver and ISubject classes, it's perfectly fine to define only a virtual destructor and rely on the default copy/move constructors and assignment operators provided by the compiler, especially since they are meant to be used as interfaces. The Clang-Tidy warning is more of a general guideline and may not apply to every situation, particularly in cases involving polymorphic base classes like yours.
