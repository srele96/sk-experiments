# OpenGL notes

## State machine

OpenGL is by itself a large state machine: a collection of variables that define how OpenGL should currently operate. The state of OpenGL is commonly referred to as the OpenGL context. When using OpenGL, we often change its state by setting some options, manipulating some buffers and then render using the current context.

Whenever we tell OpenGL that we now want to draw lines instead of triangles for example, we change the state of OpenGL by changing some context variable that sets how OpenGL should draw. As soon as we change the context by telling OpenGL it should draw lines, the next drawing commands will now draw lines instead of triangles.

When working in OpenGL we will come across several state-changing functions that change the context and several state-using functions that perform some operations based on the current state of OpenGL. As long as you keep in mind that OpenGL is basically one large state machine, most of its functionality will make more sense.

## Double buffer

When an application draws in a single buffer the resulting image may display flickering issues. This is because the resulting output image is not drawn in an instant, but drawn pixel by pixel and usually from left to right and top to bottom. Because this image is not displayed at an instant to the user while still being rendered to, the result may contain artifacts. To circumvent these issues, windowing applications apply a double buffer for rendering. The front buffer contains the final output image that is shown at the screen, while all the rendering commands draw to the back buffer. As soon as all the rendering commands are finished we swap the back buffer to the front buffer so the image can be displayed without still being rendered to, removing all the aforementioned artifacts.
