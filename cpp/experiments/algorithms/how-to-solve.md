# How to solve

[Folks who cracked google, what % of LC hard problems were you able to solve on your own?](https://leetcode.com/discuss/career/368612/Folks-who-cracked-google-what-of-LC-hard-problems-were-you-able-to-solve-on-your-own)

I cracked the Google interview twice in a row. Here's how:

1. I didn't solve hard problems at all. I solved around 400 medium problems and all easy problems on LeetCode. It's better to understand the approaches used and learn to come up with the solution yourself, instead of looking up the answer.
2. Don't look the answer at all. If you can't solve the problem in an hour, even with drawing on a notebook with a pen, just skip the question. Don't look the answer. Go back to this question in two weeks and try another hour. If you still can't solve it - try to find a hint, if there's not hints, then lookup the answer. Review this question in a month or so.
3. Practice your weak topics.
4. You'll most likely asked a hard problem on the interview. But solving many Medium LC questions will help you much more. There are many Medium problems that are harder than the Hard ones.
5. Don't run after numbers. It doesn't matter if you solved 100, 200, or 1000 problems. All that important is the quality. If you solved 200 problems, but you looked the answers for half of them, I bet you won't be able to come up with a solution to a problem you saw 3-4 weeks ago. Which means, your brain will work like a Queue.
6. Always look the top answers AFTER you solved the problem. That's how you learn new techniques and approaches.

Quality > Quantity.

Good luck.
