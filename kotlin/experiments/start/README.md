## Observation

Reference to pull request #302 and commit `7c132d874a0198a9b17c76e88e7ecefe8c1b2b4a`.

I read the Self-Reflection part.

I still do the same thing, analyse down the bottomless hole. It doesn't let me focus on completing the tasks at hand. It yields the knowledge and skill. However frequently I can get the program to work without that knowledge and skill.

The benefit of writing such self-reflection is I realized I still do it. It is a reminder to let go and not do it again.

I could use deliberate practice to attain a skill to control that habit. I say control because I find exploration habit invaluable.

Therefore I write this self-note because future me might find me useful. The current me found the self-review from the past me useful.
