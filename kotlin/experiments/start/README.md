## Java Loggers

An interesting concept used by java loggers. Libraries depend on SLF4J - Simple Logging Facade for Java. An abstraction that libraries depend on. Users can depend on any logging library that supports SLF4J. The SLF4J sits between the library and the users application and the benefit is that users aren't locked in to one logging library. A possible downside is dependency on SLF4J - I did not give much thought to that, so I am not sure.

Definitely an interesting concept, I admit!

## Nvim

[Nvim supports .editorconfig by default from version 0.9.0.](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/21633)

## Observation

Reference to pull request #302 and commit `7c132d874a0198a9b17c76e88e7ecefe8c1b2b4a`.

I read the Self-Reflection part.

I still do the same thing, analyse down the bottomless hole. It doesn't let me focus on completing the tasks at hand. It yields the knowledge and skill. However frequently I can get the program to work without that knowledge and skill.

The benefit of writing such self-reflection is I realized I still do it. It is a reminder to let go and not do it again.

I could use deliberate practice to attain a skill to control that habit. I say control because I find exploration habit invaluable.

Therefore I write this self-note because future me might find me useful. The current me found the self-review from the past me useful.
