How to start anything

ask people for advices on how to imrove, where are your mistakes, but do not
under any circumstances
DO NOT ASK THEM FOR THEIR OPINION IF WHAT YOU DO IS OK OR NOT

do not expect any support, do not expect of others to expect you to succeed

do not expect of others to support you, use others as support that you need

do not expect to keep going based on the support others give you, but the
support you take, such as drive of seing peers working harder or performing
better

whatwever i started i realized that i was so wary of thoughts of my family,
friends, other people and i realized it's not their thoughts, words, but rather
my sensitivity and self-insecurity

for example if one wants to start singing
 - don't talk about it
 - don't ask for permission
 - don't tell anyone anything about it
 - do it on your own, suck it up, stick teeth together
 - don't look for approval of anyone other than yourself

the reason is that the only person who believes in one is himself, he has none
other than himself, mutual support is essential, social support is essential,
environmental expectations are essential,

if one wants to become an expert, he has to find teachers who are the best at
what they do, once a teacher has nothing to teach you, move on to another
teacher, be careful of the bias where people rate how much they enjoyed
teacher's company, find a teacher familiar with concepts of deliberate practice
