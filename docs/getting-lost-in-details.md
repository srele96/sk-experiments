# Getting lost in details

It is interesting how I am afraid to 'get lost' in the topic. Still, I always start researching interesting side details. For example, I decided to do a quick and dirty implementation of Kruskal's algorithm an hour ago at 10 pm, and currently, it is 11:10 pm. I am trying to make an implementation decision on whether I should loop over the two-dimensional matrix representing the graph using iterators, std::algorithm, for loop, or some other way that is the best practice. Remember that I wanted to do a 'quick' and 'dirty' implementation of the algorithm, so the best approach here doesn't matter. How did I get here?

It happens every time I take anything to work. For example, I started to play World of Warcraft around 6 pm and decided to level up quickly from 60 to 70. So I bought Dragonflight expansion and wanted a pleasant experience, go through quests and content, and do some stuff they have available. Then, sometime between 9:30 pm and 10 pm, I caught myself thinking about whether I wanted to complete the quest campaign for achievement, thinking if I wished to complete all quests in the zone, completely forgetting that I wanted to go through the main content, and side-quests aren't necessary.

Is this habit good or bad? It happens when I am studying. For example, when I start reading an interesting book, I google that term and read the explanation. If I find something interesting there, I will do the same, enter an infinite loop searching for attractive terms, and get lost in details.

Another example is I remember asking my professor something about the java implementation of the hash map. I was working on a problem he gave us, but I discovered I could enter the hash map implementation. Something in there caught my eye, so I asked him about it. While working on a task, I lost myself reading the implementation of the hash map.

I don't think this habit is bad because I get work done, progress, study well, and have a job; when I asked the professor four to five years ago, I still do it.

Thinking back about that, that's what made me good at programming. I got obsessed with a new intriguing concept, and my mind wrapped around it. That purposeful practice helped me remember and hone my skills in that topic. I find myself entering the mode of purposeful practice simply out of curiosity, naive interest, and the idea sounding good. It isn't something I enforce, but it happens merely, like thinking, what will I watch next on Netflix, just for studying or whatever I am doing?

That's what everyone does, find something entertaining to do until it's not, then find something else. So, why has it helped me become a better programmer? I don't know if I am a good programmer. People around me at work tell me so, but I find it hard to believe and am always looking for proof. I am trying to embody the definition of behavior that helps me improve. I want to share it and, more importantly, define it so I can take it and further improve it. To work on it, I need to define it, and to shape it as I wish, it has to be concrete and well-defined. I feel I am doing it right, whatever I'm doing now, but I need to know why.

## Conclusion

That's it. I need to document my thoughts and have a history so I can look back, reflect and use it as a foundation for my self-research. Only I can document my progress, steps, and everything I have done, perform research, and leave traces behind me. There are standardized research facilities for many scientific areas. Still, only I can research myself and my behavior to improve further.
