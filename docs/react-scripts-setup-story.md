# React-Scripts setup

## Background story

The other day I was reading source code in react repository. I can't remember how did I come to open their fixtures directory. I found the SSR example there that was interesting. They used react scripts alone to run the client. I was surprised by the way they used them. I only ever used react-scripts through the create-react-app call. That was new to me.

Wow! I thought to myself.

## Why is it so cool that I can use react-scripts from an empty directory?

It is so cool because I used them through NPX for so long. I found a new way to do it! Of course, I am excited. Why else is it cool? Hello, a Webpack set up through a single call? Amazing! Upgrading is easy! Hell, that's so cool!

I tried it out, and here is [the repository](https://github.com/srele96/react-app-setup).

## Why README if there is a repository already?

Here is the collection of everything I do. I love this repository and like to add work to it.
