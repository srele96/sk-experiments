Reverse engineer thought process

i realized that i can only understand what i can create... reverse engineering
the thought process, how did he come up with that? how would i come up with
that?

for example, how would i come to the conclusion that single responsibility
principle is good? how would i invent it? based on which problems would i see
that it's suitable?

one good idea is to find the exact problem that the solution is solving and
figure out the thought process to figure out that solution to that problem

i realized that only what i can create i can truly understand, only the
problems that i can come up with a solution i understand, when i see someone's
solution i really have to dig into the thought process that was behind the
creation of that solution and figure out how would i solve it using that
solution? what kind of thoughts would lead me to the solution that i already
know? what kind of questions do i have to ask?

inventing already invented solutions really help understanding, do not be a
user be an inventor, creator, the person who understands it's ins and outs

being a user only takes one so far, being an inventor takes one a long way
ahead...

even if i make a mistake and we have to make a change we will make a change but
it is important that i complete the task in a reasonable amount of time and she
is possibly right that i should focus on getting things done instead of getting
it perfect hte first time, i can save som uch more time by simply getting it
done fast and fixing the things that  come up after that eve faster than
getting it right the first time, it is not simply possible
