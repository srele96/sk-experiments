throughout the book are assessments for things like
  grit
  type of parenting
  ...

student from math class, went to advanced class
didn't do geometry well, went to teacher, asked what did he do bad, what did he need to do differently
same questions from deliberate practice and asking teacher on what to improve and how

he continued, david used math to make engines more efficient
he was not ready for harder and faster math classes, was now a rocket scientist


exceptional zeal and capacity for hard labor are more important than intellectual ability
charles darvin did not posses exceptional intelligence

we have bias toward natural and hard working

hired as talented to learn immense amount of information in short time

most successfull companies agressively improve, reward the best, less the worst, increases the snowball

encourage long term improving, discourage short term performance

firing the worst 15% incrased deception and negative environment

research and proofs on how grit is more important than talent

teacher who believes in your potential, scott started wondering if he could do intellectual
he had ear infections which slowed down his sound processing, he signed up for all challenges school offered
he took cello classes and studied relentlessly for hours every day
he decided to study this thing called intelligence, signed up and got rejected
he had the grit, he will do it, he will find a way to study what he wants to study
he signed up for another school, he graduated

focus on talent distracts us from something that is important, effort

effort comes twice

why does unconscious talent for bias exist? i know better it is not about talent, it is about effort

the most dazzling human achievments are in fact, the aggregate of countless individual elements, each of which is, in a sense, ordinary

drilled into a habbit, then fitted together in a whole, they are done consistently, and correctly, producing excellence

our self-love promotes the cult of the genius niche said
thinking is active in one direction
who zealously observe their own inner life
never tire of combining the means available to them
fridrih niche thought about skill, perfection that we observe, if perfection is divine, we don't need to compete

craftsmen as example above all others
craftsmen don't talk about greatness, they acquire greatness, making all secondary things well, than in the result
  (maps to results of my current skill in web dev?)
  (maps to results of my studying of c++?)

those who perceive everywhere models and incentives, whose thinking is active in one direction, who never tire to combine the means available to them

SHE ALSO REPEATEDLY THROUGHOUT THE BOOK SAYS THAT WE REFER TO TALENT TO AVOID EFFORT!!! I HAD SAME THOUGHTS!

doing something thats not natural, over and over again, becomes natural

threadmill exercise, people who passed threadmill that was exhausting
the follow up research, calls on them every 2 yrs
threadmill had good corresponding results to their success in life

grit is to preserve in only one thing, achieve the skill, expertise, produce goods or services valuable to people
grit is not doing something incredibly hard
grit is doing something you love so much, longer than most people imagine, willing to stay loyal to it

sustained devotion, how long can i stay working on one thing consistently?

the guy was always into journalism, when he visited africa, passion emerged over period of years, active construction, he created his passion
moved to new york, could not predic career, major in phylosophy, easiest to fulfil requirements, visited east africa, it was begining of beginning
he went to oxford, he didn't know what he wants to study, professors told him he shouldn't be there

passion as a compass, a thing that takes some time to build, tinker with, then guides you on your way where you want to be
do you have a life phylosophy?

3 level of goals
  low level
  mid level
  high level

goal hierarchy, work, personal... ideally we have one, which is extremist

life level goal, pitch as best as possibly can, high level goal, ultimate concern that gives direction and meaning
high pitcher, Tom Seaver, "the best i possibly can, day after day, year after year"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Seaver
each day thinking about the questions i fell asleep with, thinking about next step, calling your focus obsessive, life philosophy

grit is about holding the same high level goal, for the very long time

warren buffer advice to his pilot
write down 25 career goals, do some soul searching and pick 5 highest priority, take a good look at avoid other 20 at all cost they eat away time

"i am happy when i pitch well, so i will do anything that helps me pitch well"

passion is not sudden all at one, first encounter is just that
passion is a little bit of discovery, followed by a lifetime of deepening

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Shortz
will shortz mom encouraged him to do what he was interested in, she advised him to sell puzzles once he made them
she noticed that her son was blooming into world class problem solver, she nurtured it
encourage your kids what they are interested in, i should do what i am interested in and discover if i like it or not
he engineered various things, his mom saw him with a screwdriver, sat with him and helped him
it is not important that i understand everything, it is important that i listed, her friend and her sat as he built things,
  he came to explain to his mom what he was doing and all the science behind it
even asmongold's mom supported him streaming, youtube, games, doing what he was interested in

what do i like to think about?
where does my mind wonder?
how do i enjoy spending my time?
what do i find absolutely unbearable?

desire to excel beyond the current level of skill, persistent desire to do better

YAY! The book talks about Anders Ericson!

set very specific and measurable goals, zero in on o ne narrowing aspect of their overall performance
at every practice, try to beat myself
interested in what i did wrong, rather than what i did right
immediate feedback

the type of practice mattered tremendously, deliberate practice of self learning of words speller didn't know, quiz to diagnose weakness, focus on mastering weakness
clearly defined stretch goal, immediate feedback
make deliberate practice a habit

reflect on how the work i already do can have a positive contribution to the society
  (i kind of already did that by thinking that it is essential that i contribute to the society, my skills are useless on their own)
  (reflecting on purpose enhanced students results and results on their tests)
  (how can my work make the world better place? create more ideas... ponder on it)
think about how in small but meaningful ways, i can change my work to enhance it's connection to my core values
  https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/job-crafting-and-creating-meaning-in-your-work/
  Dr. Amy Wrzesniewski
  (at google they made workshop to think of how to make their job more meaningful, they were more productive after that)
find inspiration in your purposeful role model
  (who will i be in 15 years? does anyone inspire me?)

she decided to push through, simulate exam environment, practice for hours in simulated environment, push until she succeed
  (dogs helplessness experiment, dogs were taught that they are helpless)
  (our responses are habitual, like in dogs, even though we can think)

praise effort and learning over natural talent, kip school

find cognitive behavioral therapist to remove pessimism and ingrain optimistic thinking
remove ingrained pessimistic bias, resilience training
with practice and guidance i can change how i think, feel as the going gets rough
for teaching myself hope, ask for a helping hand

you are not a writer, you are someone who writes something down on paper
a writer finishes his work, start and finish what you start

types of parenting affects how children grow up and how their grit develops

we are mentors to all people around us, we can teach all young people around us

as a teacher set expectations, demanding, supportive
i have high expectations, i know you can fulfil them
understand what is going on in someone else's life, cody, his brother, teacher, mit students...

kids thrive doing hard things every week that interest them
pick one thing and do it for at least a year, even better 2 years

hanging out with friends is fun, but not challenging
being in class is challenging, but not fun
extracurricular activities are both fun and challenging
they are especially beneficial when done for more than a year

__ PERSONAL NOTE __

IF I FEEL DISCOMFORT AT HEARING AN IDEA OF WHAT I NEED TO DO NEXT, THATS THE RIGHT HTING TO DO, IT GETS ME OUT OF COMFORT ZONE TO IMPROVE

they did what they felt was right...
