The Chainsaw Man Album With Cool Scaling and Movement

The picture's sizes scale to the right and left of the image that's currently on top above all others. The top photo is the largest. Clicking different pictures enlarges them, scales, and moves the others appropriately.

## Danger

The design of the code does not produce scalable code that follows the Single Responsibility principle. I designed the code with simplicity in mind. I originally wanted to create mathematical calculations for the arrangement of movements, but that produced code that was hard to understand. A code with exact values is much easier to understand because the reader does not need to understand the reasoning behind each formula.
