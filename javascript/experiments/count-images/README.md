# Count images in directory

My friend wanted to count images in directory using `load` and `error` event
on image element. I thought it was interesting idea, so here is the source
code for it.

## How to run

Create directory `images` and add images with names:

- `1.png`
- `2.png`
- `3.png`

Open `index.html` in the browser.
