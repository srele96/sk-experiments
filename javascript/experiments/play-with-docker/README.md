# Play with docker

Create services and turn them into containers using docker and docker compose.

Ignore all good practices for the sake of practicing and playing around with docker configuration.

## Documentation

Initially:

```powershell
docker compose up
```

If you make changes to docker files or code:

```powershell
docker compose up --build
```
