# ChatGPT conversation

Documentation of my conversation with ChatGPT as I was trying to understand quaternions, conversion from vector to quaternion and back, rotation using quaternions, and more.

## How to read

Start from the conversation with the highest number.

The initial conversation is [26_conv.txt](./26_conv.txt).

You can see by my questions that I was trying to attack the problem with various questions and to reverse engineer the thinking process of how to use them.

I believe my mistake was that at some point I stopped reverse engineering and all became confusing because I lost control of the process.

## Why I uploaded chats

They might get lost and I believe I dug up important information about this topic in this round.

I might refer to it later because I often reuse my old materials to build up on the previous knowledge.
