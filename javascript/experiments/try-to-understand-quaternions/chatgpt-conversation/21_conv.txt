this calculation uses quaternion [w,x,y,z] , i want calculation here

rewrite this:

      const w1 = this.w;
      const x1 = this.x;
      const y1 = this.y;
      const z1 = this.z;

      const w2 = other.w;
      const x2 = other.x;
      const y2 = other.y;
      const z2 = other.z;

to use

      const resultW =
      const resultX =
      const resultY =
      const resultZ =

can you assign to this result?

Certainly! Based on the provided code snippet, you can rewrite it to assign the result to the variables resultW, resultX, resultY, and resultZ as follows:

javascript

const w1 = this.w;
const x1 = this.x;
const y1 = this.y;
const z1 = this.z;

const w2 = other.w;
const x2 = other.x;
const y2 = other.y;
const z2 = other.z;

const resultW = w1 * w2 - x1 * x2 - y1 * y2 - z1 * z2;
const resultX = w1 * x2 + x1 * w2 + y1 * z2 - z1 * y2;
const resultY = w1 * y2 - x1 * z2 + y1 * w2 + z1 * x2;
const resultZ = w1 * z2 + x1 * y2 - y1 * x2 + z1 * w2;

Now the calculated values will be assigned to the variables resultW, resultX, resultY, and resultZ respectively.
