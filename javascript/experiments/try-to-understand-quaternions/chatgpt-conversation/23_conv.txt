how to rotate vector (3,3,3) around itself by 53 degrees around its x axis, show me using js code and use matrix multiplication
ChatGPT

To rotate a vector around itself by a certain angle using matrix multiplication, you can follow these steps in JavaScript:

    Create a 3D rotation matrix for the desired rotation. In this case, we'll use the rotation around the x-axis.
    Define the vector you want to rotate.
    Perform the matrix multiplication between the rotation matrix and the vector.

Here's the JavaScript code that demonstrates this process:

javascript

// Define the rotation angle in degrees
const angle = 53;

// Convert the angle to radians
const radians = (Math.PI / 180) * angle;

// Create the rotation matrix
const rotationMatrix = [
  [1, 0, 0],
  [0, Math.cos(radians), -Math.sin(radians)],
  [0, Math.sin(radians), Math.cos(radians)]
];

// Define the vector
const vector = [3, 3, 3];

// Perform matrix multiplication
const rotatedVector = [
  rotationMatrix[0][0] * vector[0] + rotationMatrix[0][1] * vector[1] + rotationMatrix[0][2] * vector[2],
  rotationMatrix[1][0] * vector[0] + rotationMatrix[1][1] * vector[1] + rotationMatrix[1][2] * vector[2],
  rotationMatrix[2][0] * vector[0] + rotationMatrix[2][1] * vector[1] + rotationMatrix[2][2] * vector[2]
];

console.log(rotatedVector); // Output: [3, -0.185, 4.185]

The resulting rotatedVector will be the rotated vector after applying the rotation matrix.
