how to rotate vector (3,3,3) around itself by 53 degrees around its x axis, show me using js code
ChatGPT

To rotate a vector around itself by a certain angle around its x-axis, you can use a rotation matrix. Here's an example of how you can achieve this using JavaScript:

javascript

// Define the vector
var vector = [3, 3, 3];

// Convert the angle from degrees to radians
var angle = 53 * Math.PI / 180;

// Define the rotation matrix
var rotationMatrix = [
  [1, 0, 0],
  [0, Math.cos(angle), -Math.sin(angle)],
  [0, Math.sin(angle), Math.cos(angle)]
];

// Perform the rotation
var rotatedVector = [
  rotationMatrix[0][0] * vector[0] + rotationMatrix[0][1] * vector[1] + rotationMatrix[0][2] * vector[2],
  rotationMatrix[1][0] * vector[0] + rotationMatrix[1][1] * vector[1] + rotationMatrix[1][2] * vector[2],
  rotationMatrix[2][0] * vector[0] + rotationMatrix[2][1] * vector[1] + rotationMatrix[2][2] * vector[2]
];

// Output the rotated vector
console.log(rotatedVector);

This code first defines the vector as [3, 3, 3] and converts the rotation angle from degrees to radians. Then it defines the rotation matrix based on the angle and performs the matrix multiplication with the original vector to obtain the rotated vector. Finally, the rotated vector is outputted to the console.

Keep in mind that this code assumes the vector is represented as an array, and the resulting rotated vector will also be in the form of an array.
