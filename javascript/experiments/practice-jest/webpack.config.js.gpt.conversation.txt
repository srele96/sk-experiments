Developing a webpack plugin involves a deep understanding of webpack's architecture and its plugin system. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you develop a plugin for webpack:

    Understand Webpack's Core Concepts:
        Entry: The entry point for the application.
        Output: Where the bundled files should be emitted and how they should be named.
        Loaders: Transformations that are applied to the source code of modules.
        Plugins: A broad spectrum of tasks like bundle optimization, asset management, and injection of environment variables.

    Webpack's Plugin System:
        Plugins are the backbone of webpack. They are designed to work at various stages of the bundling process, allowing you to hook into those stages and modify the output.

    Setting Up:
        Start with a new project. Install webpack and webpack-cli.
        Create a basic webpack.config.js.

    Developing Your First Plugin:
        Webpack plugins are JavaScript objects with an apply method on their prototype.
        The apply method is passed a compiler object which gives you access to the entire webpack build lifecycle.

    javascript

    class MyFirstWebpackPlugin {
      apply(compiler) {
        compiler.hooks.done.tap('MyFirstWebpackPlugin', (stats) => {
          console.log('Compilation has finished!');
        });
      }
    }

    module.exports = MyFirstWebpackPlugin;

    Understanding Compiler and Compilation:
        Compiler: Responsible for the entire build and starting the process. You'll interact with hooks provided by it for the build lifecycle.
        Compilation: Contains information about the current build. For example, all your modules, dependencies, and files are stored on the compilation instance.

    Using Hooks:
        Webpack's plugin system is based on a hooks infrastructure, which allows you to tap into specific stages of the build process.
        There are various hooks available, e.g., entryOption, afterPlugins, run, emit, done, etc.

    Async Handling:
        If your plugin does asynchronous tasks, you should make sure to handle it properly. For this, you can utilize tapAsync or tapPromise.

    Accessing Modules and Assets:
        You can access and modify modules and assets within the build using the compilation object.

    Testing Your Plugin:
        It's essential to write tests to ensure your plugin works as expected. Webpack uses jest for testing.

    Publishing:

    Once you're satisfied with your plugin, you can publish it to npm to make it available for others.

    Documentation:

    Ensure to write clear documentation that explains what your plugin does, how to install it, and how to use it.

    Stay Updated:

    Webpack is actively developed. Ensure to keep track of any changes, especially major releases, as they might affect your plugin.

Finally, consider reading the source code of popular webpack plugins and reviewing the official webpack documentation, especially the section on writing a plugin. It provides valuable insights and best practices.

so i can `tap` in the process? what if i want to see each processed asset?

---

ChatGPT

Yes, by using the hooks system in webpack, you can tap into various stages of the compilation process. If you want to see each processed asset, you'll want to hook into the emit phase of the compilation. During the emit phase, all assets have been processed and are about to be written to the output file system (typically your dist directory).

Here's a basic example of how you can tap into the emit hook and log each asset:

javascript

class LogAssetsPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.emit.tapAsync('LogAssetsPlugin', (compilation, callback) => {
      for (let filename in compilation.assets) {
        console.log(filename);
      }
      callback();  // Ensure to call the callback function, especially when using tapAsync.
    });
  }
}

module.exports = LogAssetsPlugin;

You can then include this plugin in your webpack configuration:

javascript

const LogAssetsPlugin = require('./path-to-your-plugin-file');

module.exports = {
  // ... other webpack config properties ...
  plugins: [
    new LogAssetsPlugin()
  ]
};

When you run webpack, it will log the name of each asset as it's about to be emitted.

Keep in mind:

    Understanding the compilation Object: The compilation object provides information about the current build. It has many properties and methods that you can explore. The assets property is a key-value mapping where the key is the asset filename and the value is the asset's content/source.

    Synchronous vs Asynchronous: In the example, we used tapAsync which allows asynchronous operations. Always remember to call the provided callback function once your operations are done, or webpack will hang indefinitely. If you're doing synchronous operations, you can use tap instead and avoid dealing with the callback.

    Impact on Build Performance: Be cautious about doing heavy computations in your plugins, especially if you're iterating over all assets or modules. This can significantly impact build performance.

Exploring other hooks and the webpack source code can give you a better understanding of the internals and how you might further customize or analyze your builds.

give me some examples of things doable with webpack plugin

ChatGPT

Absolutely! Webpack plugins offer a powerful way to interact with and customize the build process. Here's a diverse set of tasks that can be accomplished using Webpack plugins:

    Asset Versioning: Append a hash or version number to the output filenames to prevent cache issues.

    Bundle Analysis: Generate a visual representation of your bundle to see which modules are taking up space. The webpack-bundle-analyzer is a great example of this.

    Custom Templating: Modify the default HTML template or generate additional assets/files based on the build. The popular html-webpack-plugin allows for custom templating and more.

    Environment Variables: Inject environment-specific variables at compile time. DefinePlugin is a built-in plugin that achieves this.

    CSS Extraction: Extract CSS from the JS bundle into separate files. This is what mini-css-extract-plugin does.

    Cleanup: Clean up the output directory before each build, ensuring no old files are left. The clean-webpack-plugin is an example.

    Compression: Compress your JavaScript bundle using algorithms like Gzip or Brotli. The compression-webpack-plugin achieves this.

    Internationalization (i18n): Replace tokens in your codebase with translated strings based on different

give me an idea what my plugin can do, i wanna see the inner workings, i wanna see how content is processed, i wanna see the module content before and after, idk, i have this

const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');

class LearnPlugin {
  pluginName = 'LearnPlugin';

  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.done.tap(this.pluginName, (stats) => {
      console.log('LearnPlugin: done');
    });
    compiler.hooks.emit.tap(this.pluginName, (compilation) => {
      console.log({ compilation });
    });
  }
}

/** @type {import('webpack').Configuration} */
const config = {
  entry: './entry.js',
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.js$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: {
          loader: 'babel-loader',
        },
      },
    ],
  },
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: './index.html',
      inject: 'body',
    }),
    new LearnPlugin(),
  ],
};

module.exports = config;

Your current configuration taps into the done and emit hooks of Webpack's compiler. These hooks represent specific points in the build lifecycle.

If you want to see the inner workings and explore how content is processed, there are a few things you can do with your custom plugin:

    Log Each Moduleâ€™s Before-and-After Source Code: This will give you insight into how Webpack processes each module in your dependency graph.

    javascript

compiler.hooks.emit.tap(this.pluginName, (compilation) => {
  compilation.modules.forEach((module) => {
    console.log('Original Source:', module.originalSource().source());
    console.log('Final Source:', module.source());
  });
});

Log All Assets Being Emitted: This can help you understand what assets (JS, CSS, images, etc.) are being outputted by Webpack.

javascript

compiler.hooks.emit.tap(this.pluginName, (compilation) => {
  console.log('Assets:', Object.keys(compilation.assets));
});

Monitor Chunk Creation: Chunks are collections of modules bundled together by Webpack. Seeing how chunks are created and which modules they contain can be enlightening.

javascript

compiler.hooks.compilation.tap(this.pluginName, (compilation) => {
  compilation.hooks.afterOptimizeChunks.tap(this.pluginName, (chunks) => {
    chunks.forEach((chunk) => {
      console.log('Chunk:', chunk.name || chunk.id, 'Modules:', chunk.getModules().map(m => m.id));
    });
  });
});

Customize the Output Assets: For example, append a comment to all JS files. This might not be particularly useful but can help you understand how to modify content.

javascript

    compiler.hooks.emit.tapAsync(this.pluginName, (compilation, callback) => {
      Object.keys(compilation.assets).forEach((assetName) => {
        if (assetName.endsWith('.js')) {
          const assetContent = compilation.assets[assetName].source();
          compilation.assets[assetName] = {
            source: () => `${assetContent}\n// Custom comment by LearnPlugin`,
            size: () => assetContent.length + 30, // +30 for the comment length
          };
        }
      });
      callback();
    });

While these are just examples, they can help you start exploring the vast capabilities of Webpack plugins. Remember, with great power comes great responsibility! Ensure that any changes you make to the compilation process are intentional and tested, especially if you're considering using these plugins in production.

TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'get')

  compilation.modules.forEach((module) => {
    console.log('Original Source:', module.originalSource().source());
    console.log('Final Source:', module.source());
  });

The error suggests that the originalSource or source method of a module is returning undefined. This can happen if a module doesn't have an associated source, which can be the case for some types of modules in Webpack.

To handle this gracefully, you can check if these methods exist and are functions before calling them:

javascript

compiler.hooks.emit.tap(this.pluginName, (compilation) => {
  compilation.modules.forEach((module) => {
    if (typeof module.originalSource === 'function') {
      const original = module.originalSource();
      if (original) {
        console.log('Original Source:', original.source());
      }
    }

    if (typeof module.source === 'function') {
      const source = module.source();
      if (source) {
        console.log('Final Source:', source.source());
      }
    }
  });
});

This code first checks whether originalSource and source are functions before calling them. After that, it checks whether the results of these functions are truthy (not null or undefined) before attempting to call the source method on the results.

Note that Webpack's internals and the structure of modules can vary depending on the version of Webpack and the specific loaders and plugins used. Always refer to the specific version's documentation or source code if you're unsure about the inner workings.

(node:17596) [DEP_WEBPACK_COMPILATION_ASSETS] DeprecationWarning: Compilation.assets will be frozen in future, all modifications are deprecated.
BREAKING CHANGE: No more changes should happen to Compilation.assets after sealing the Compilation.
        Do changes to assets earlier, e. g. in Compilation.hooks.processAssets.
        Make sure to select an appropriate stage from Compilation.PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_*.
(Use `node --trace-deprecation ...` to show where the warning was created)

The warning you're seeing is Webpack informing you about a change in its API that pertains to the way assets are handled during the compilation process. Let's break down what this warning is saying:

    Compilation.assets will be frozen in future: In future versions of Webpack, the Compilation.assets object will be immutable (frozen) once the compilation has been sealed. This means that after a certain point in the build process, you can't modify, add, or delete assets.

    all modifications are deprecated: You shouldn't be making modifications to Compilation.assets anymore.

    Do changes to assets earlier, e. g. in Compilation.hooks.processAssets: Webpack suggests that if you want to modify assets, you should do it during the processAssets hook.

    Make sure to select an appropriate stage from Compilation.PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_*: When using the processAssets hook, you have to choose a stage. The stages determine the order in which your modifications occur, relative to other plugins and processes.

To adapt to this change, if you (or any of the plugins you are using) modify assets, you'll want to migrate that logic to use the processAssets hook. Here's a simplified example:

javascript

class MyPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.thisCompilation.tap('MyPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.processAssets.tap(
        {
          name: 'MyPlugin',
          stage: Compilation.PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_ADDITIONAL, // Choose an appropriate stage
        },
        (assets) => {
          // Modify assets here
        }
      );
    });
  }
}

The key takeaway is to move asset manipulations to the processAssets hook and choose an appropriate stage for your modifications. This change in Webpack aims to make asset handling more predictable and efficient.

If you're not directly modifying Compilation.assets in your plugins, then the warning might be coming from a third-party plugin. If that's the case, ensure all your plugins are up-to-date, as plugin authors should be updating their plugins to be compatible with the latest Webpack APIs.

give me an idea for a webpack plugin


---


ChatGPT

Certainly! Here are a few ideas for Webpack plugins:

    Image Optimization Plugin:
        After all assets have been processed, loop through image assets.
        Compress and optimize image assets using an optimization library or service.
        Replace the original images with the optimized ones in the output.

    Asset Versioning Plugin:
        Add a unique hash to the file names of all assets.
        This helps in cache busting whenever you deploy a new version of your application.

    Code Comment Stripper:
        Process JS and CSS files to remove all comments.
        Useful for removing TODO comments or other unnecessary content in production builds.

    Custom Logger Plugin:
        Log information about the build process in a custom format.
        Can log into a file, send to an external service, or even notify via SMS or email if a build fails.

    Unused CSS Remover:
        Analyze the final build to detect any unused CSS.
        Remove unused CSS rules to reduce the size of the output CSS file.

    Internationalization (i18n) Plugin:
        Allow users to specify various language configurations.
        Generate separate bundles for each language, replacing texts with translations on-the-fly.

    License Checker Plugin:
        Scan all included modules for license information.
        Warn or error if non-compliant licenses are detected.

    Dependency Visualizer:
        Create a visual tree of all your dependencies.
        Output it as an interactive graph on an HTML page.

    File Banner Plugin:
        Add a custom comment/banner (like version, build date, etc.) to the top of each output file.

    Custom Templating:

    Convert custom template files (like .mytemplate) into JavaScript modules.
    Allow users to import and use them directly in their applications.

When creating a plugin, always ensure you have a clear use-case in mind, and check if there's an existing solution already. If there is, consider how your plugin can offer added value, either through enhanced features, better performance, or improved user experience. Once you decide on an idea, you can dive deep into the Webpack documentation to understand the best hooks and APIs to use for your plugin's needs.
