# More Fractals

Have more fun playing with fractals and designing functions using JavaScript.

I was having fun playing around with fractals that I've created. I got carried away and here are some fractal canopy that I've generated using different values.

### Base Fractal Canopy with two equal branches

### Fractal Canopy with right angle more to the right

### Fractal Canopy with right angle more to the right and more levels

### Fractal Canopy with smaller angle and high levels that increase thickness

### Fractal Canopy with highly scaled branches and small angles

### Fractal Canopy with small angles, non-equal branches and high thickness

### Fractal Canopy with three branches with 90 degree angle and decreased scale on the sides

### Fractal Canopy with three branches with 45 degree angle and decreased scale on the sides

### Fractal Canopy with two branches, right side scale is smaller with larger angle to right
