# How do ESLint custom rules work?

I was curious and decided to:

- Create a configuration.
- Create file with lint error.
- Lint the file.
- See the error myself.

## Note after more than a year later

I remember when it was a big deal for me that I can define a custom rule in ESLin configuration. I have come a long way from that time and I still have a long way to go!
