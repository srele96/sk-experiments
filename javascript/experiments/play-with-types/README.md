# Play with types

Play with TypeScript types.

## Motivation

I was surprised that I could do recursion over types and that kind of logic. That intrigued me so I decided to play with it for a while.

## Utility types

[TypeScript utility types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html)

The utility types page picked my interest, they are quite interesting. Recreating them helps me familiarize myself with how types work. I never thought about types in such a way so far. Now I am pretty sure I can do these kind of things using C++ templates. That's most likely how currently C++ Standard Library works. Generic programming is cool!

## Additional motivation

I was intrigued by the problem of determining a type of other property or more properties based on one property. I found the problem interesting and decided to create a few alternative and play with them.
