Notes on deliberate practice application


deliberate practise is purposeful practise that
- knows where it is going
- knows how to get there


objective reproducible measures of experts best of the best
what does the expert do that makes him excel more than the rest
how does the expert train to be better than others?
how to setup feedback what i'm doing wrong?


how to choose who to learn from?


the guy who chased to learn golf
  - set really concrete spreadsheet of topics to improve on
  - create a diary of studying, what, how much, how long, what did i do wrong, what did i do right, what can i improve


the best teachers didn't set on the rules to particular problems
encouraged students to think about general patterns and processes
the why more than how, this was motivating to the children because it raised their intelectual interests
(this is true because i admire good code when i see it because i can glance at surface of how much effort is behind it)


* break the thing down so it is just 10% above my maximum (learn the next atopic step towards larger goal)

* use deliberate practice to learn algorithms from the book
  - engage intelectual process
  - find learning resource
  - how to achieve the same thing they achieved
  - set measureable goals
  - learn, get feedback (maybe like benjamin franklin), fix mistakes, create mental representations



* with the right training, it is possible to achieve exceptionalism
    - Paul T. Brady has tried to learn perfect pitch by himself and didn't succeed
    - after age 32 he found an article on how to learn one note, he decided to use it as foundation
    - after two months of following the training regime, he decided to try it out
    - for a month or so his wife played one key note on piano, after that was done, he checked results
    - he got 37 right and 8 off by half or more, which was very close
    - with the right training, any skill can be learned
    - __USE_BOOKS_ON_SOFTWARE_ENGINEERING_FROM_GENERALLY_ACCEPTED_PUBLISHERS__, CLEAN_CODE, ETC


* pathbreakers - raise to the level of exceptional people before and make a breakthrough (scrabble, pablo picaso)

* obsessing over one thing (autistic savante's are more likely to obsess over one thing and develop highly efficient methods)

* a way to consistently push myself above the current skill






__ thinking ' how to make x ' yields context and creates mental representations, for example:
'how to calculate latency?'
'how to create recursion tree'
''


Things to do to improve the training:
  * specific training for things i am weak at

* representations of fundamentals
* how can i effectively learn each algorithm concept

* the students thought about questions
  - they thought about why it is important, how can they use concepts
  - questions made them think like physicists

* what is the fundamental problem of learning concept?

* the goal 'what should a person be able to do?' is different than path 'how to get there?'

Questions to ask:
  * where do i want to go?
  * how do i get there?

Build mental representation by:
  - doing something
  - trying to achieve it
  - failing
  - revising
  - trying again, over, and over again

* What should I be able to do?

* I should gain the ability to improvise and explore on my own

* An expert can understand what it takes to become an expert in other field

* what defines an expert?
* how do an experts mental representations look like?
* a new world with many experts
* what does ane xpert do and how to get there?
