validate the concept of reusability

create three samples
- sample one can use `sandbox` dependency boost
- sample two can use `sandbox` dependency boost
- sample three can use module that i wrote (no... i'll do it if i feel like it)
- all samples are independent executables

create a separate pull request for:
- sandbox setup with samples/modules & dependencies
- linting & formatting
- samples & modules (no need to add modules now)
