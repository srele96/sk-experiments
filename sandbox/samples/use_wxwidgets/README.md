## Story

Initially I got only Mie in the window.

However after a while I also got Komura and Mia in the window.

My impressions so far:

- Obviously, if someone told me that working with C++ graphics library to create graphical user interfaces is different than what I'm used to in HTML, CSS, JS... I would say sure. However it is **ABSOLUTELY DIFFERENT TO EXPERIENCE IT FIRST HAND**!
- I am surprised that I did calculation to resize the pictures from the code. I am thinking about trying some tool that will allow me to place elements in an easier fashion, however I want to write code!
- I want to document the process because I frequently come back and reflect on the stuff that I've done.

### Difficulty

I don't feel the difficulty of learning how to do this. The worst part is debugging stuff that doesn't work. However theoretical concepts of how these things work together are familiar to me.

There are some unfamiliar concepts such as bitmaps, but it seems I don't need to know them to use them, obviously!

I am eager to ramp up the difficulty. The only challenge I have so far is creating mental representations of how these things work together. I am eager to put together a graphical app similar to the ones that I've done on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/Flexos96/pen/NWELEgq).
